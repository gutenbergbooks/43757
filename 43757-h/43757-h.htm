<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.2em;'>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Although seduction as an applied art has been
slowly developing over a period of several generations,
the science of seduction has so far been
largely neglected. While the value of the empirical
knowledge acquired by early practitioners
and transmitted to us by a great body of folk-lore
should not be minimized, the trial and error
methods of these precursors, both amateur and
professional, are to be deplored as crude; for however
refined they may have been in application,
there is evidence that they were lacking in that
exactness in observation which could make them
valuable to science.</p>

<p>Only a very few though hardy pioneers have
in the past, recognized the necessity for organizing
man’s empirical knowledge of this vast subject on
a rational basis, and it is due to their unselfish
labours alone that we now have a sufficient body of
observed phenomena, a sufficient accumulation of
data, to make possible the beginnings of a true
science of seduction. It is the purpose of this
book, to co-ordinate the efforts of these for the
most part anonymous and forgotten contributors,
these modest, silent benefactors, and to attempt
a proper classification within the subject: to adumbrate
such practical methods of procedure as may
in the, let us hope, near future develop into a sure
technique. Owing to the limitations of space and
the present confused state of the subject, it is of
necessity only possible here to indicate the lines
which such a development must follow. It is my
desire to confine this work to a purely practical
consideration of the subject, and to make it a
handbook in the hope that my students and those
who come after me will be the better able to add
to the body of our observed knowledge of seduction
and to indicate the more clearly for my
shortcomings along what lines improvement
is required.</p>

<h1 id='whatis'>WHAT IS SEDUCTION?</h1>

<p>In the first place, the word itself is unfortunately
obscure, possessing an ambiguity which we
must resolve before we can proceed. I have assembled
an assortment of representative definitions,
which follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Se-duce (se-dus) <span class='it'>v.t.</span>; <span class='sc'>SE-DUCED</span> (se-dust); <span class='sc'>SE-DUCING</span>
(-dusing). [L. <span class='it'>seducere, seductum; se-aside</span>—<span class='it'>ducere</span>
to lead. See <span class='sc'>DUKE</span>.] I. To lead aside or astray, esp.
from the path of rectitude or duty; to entice to evil; to corrupt.</p>

</div>

<p>It is obvious that these interpretations all suffer
from a common fault: they fail to reflect the
modern ramifications of the word. As a matter
of fact, seduction is undergoing a great change.</p>

<p>The rudiments of the custom may be observed
in the remnants of primitive society that we are
able to study. Certain aboriginal tribes practise
polyandry as an economic adjustment to the surplus
of males.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> With the development of civilization
we find that adaptation tends to take the form
of matriarchy, as in the United States.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>In the early days of our culture, seduction was
practised upon certain species of recognized placer
in the social system, and thus attained a certain
grade of standardization. There were the seduced
(always the feminine sex) and the seducers
(masculine). It would appear that with the aforementioned
rise of matriarchy this state of affairs
is changing. The predatory instinct of humanity
is not confined to the male. However, the line
of reasoning suggested is too vast to follow in the
limits of a small volume, and I mention it merely
that the student may think about it at his leisure
as he peruses the forthcoming chapters.</p>

<p>The extraordinary development of prostitution
in the nineteenth century prefaced the present
phase with a last manifestation of the old social
attitude. Relying upon the assumption that the
male seduces the female, we are faced in this
modern world with the undeniable fact that the
ranks of the seduced—i.e., the unprotected young
women of society—are also shifting and changing.
The orderly arrangement which we have been led
to expect is breaking up. In former times our
women were divided into two main classes, or
groups:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>(a) Professionals (those who made a vocation of being seduced)<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>(b) Amateurs (those to whom the process of being seduced was a side line).<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p>However in late years there has grown up
among us a third class, designated as (c), The
only familiar term which has yet been applied was
coined by Doctor Ethel Waters, who invented for
them the descriptive appellation “freebies” in
recognition of their independent stand in the matter
of economics and convention. These revolutionists
have formulated a philosophy which draws
upon those of both older classes for its sources.
To be freebie, seduction is neither a means of livelihood,
as in the case of class (a), nor inevitable
disgrace, as it is with class (b).<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly this school of thought that influenced
the Missouri jurist who, after a long and
tiresome case of seduction, in which he found for
the defendant, made a pronouncement from the
bench to the effect that “There is no such thing as
seduction.”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> Although in my opinion this statement
is somewhat extreme for our purposes, it
serves to demonstrate the modern trend of sentiment.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The modern social attitude had its prototype
in the days of Cleopatra, where, as every classical
scholar knows, the women of the upper classes exhibited
an amazing independence. In Rome and
Alexandria “the professional courtesans were
gloomily complaining that their business had been
hard hit by the fact that the ladies of fashion
asked no payment for exertions of a similar
nature.”<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Taking these facts into consideration, we must
admit that in the light of modern improvement a
new definition is required: one more in line with
present day practice. For the purpose of this
treatise let it be understood therefore that <span class='it'>seduction
is the process of persuading someone to do
that which he or she has wanted to do all the
time</span>.</p>

<h2 id='t287'>SEDUCTION IN HISTORY</h2>

<p>The records preserved from older civilizations
are (as has been said before) too fundamental in
treatment to be of much value to us in the matter
of details. We know, however, that the mythology
and folklore of any race presents a more or
less accurate idea of the customs of the time.
Granting an amount of exaggeration in the fables,
we have still the proof that seduction has always
been a recognized practice in Heaven. Scarcely
a god has not dabbled in the art at one time or
another. In the first place they start off with the
advantages of divinity and a working knowledge
of black magic.<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> They could be called seducers
in the true sense of the word only by courtesy.
Jupiter, to take an example, used methods of
archaic and brutal simplicity. To be sure, he
would sometimes take the trouble to turn himself
into a swan or a bull or a shower of gold, but
such exercises are second nature to a deity and
cause no delay or exhaustion. Ammon, the Egyptian
god, associated exclusively with royalty, and
no one thought of calling him to task for such
moral irregularities. On the contrary, the kingly
family was proud of him.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>A close study of the ancient Indians reveals the
fact that they deemed seduction one of the most
important of the arts, rivalling philosophy in popularity
as a study.<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> The Chinese with their customary
reserve, make no mention of such matters
in official papers, but a quantity of poetry and
maxims discloses a keen Oriental interest in the
topic.<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> The Old Testament abounds in stories of
seduction by means of trickery, bribery and simple
persuasion. It is safe to assume from the records
that seduction in all parts of the civilized world
was at about the same stage of primary development.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages show some progress. Literature
was growing into an important culture, and
we have much more source material. There are
manifestations of refinement in the ancient game,
but at the same time the world was not as
light-hearted about these matters as it had been in the
past. The growth of the Church, with its set
ideas of these subjects and its zeal to catalogue
the sins of mankind and to deal out punishment
accordingly, gave to seduction its greatest impetus.
At no other time in history has such a vast amount
of time and thought been expended on one idea.
It became a sin, and therefore a necessity.</p>

<p>Added to the stimulation of the churchly attitude
was that of the caste system, which made seduction
the only means of communication between
the classes. The Renaissance introduced a new
fashion, persuasion by means of bribery. Kings
and their courtiers led the movement by elevating
their mistresses to dizzy heights of power and
wealth. The sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries witnessed an influx of new families and
the ascent of many a lowly maiden. Several of the
noblest families of England trace their origin to
such glittering seductions.<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a> Indeed
this process
became at one time so notorious that it crept into
folklore and has been preserved for us in many
a ballad, of which the following is representative:</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“She was poor but she was honest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Victim of the Squire’s whim.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>Even before this period, England had introduced
a variation of the art in the form of Chivalry.
This school of behaviour, while professing
an ignorance of the very rudiments of seduction,
nevertheless played an important part in its development,
as is convincingly illustrated by the old
song:</p>

<div class='poetry-container'><div class='lgp'>
<p class='line0'>“In days of old, when knights were bold</p>
<p class='line0'>And barons held their sway,</p>
<p class='line0'>A warrior bold, with spurs of gold,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sang merrily his lay.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>But aside from the royal habits, there was no
imagination, no finesse to seduction. It was a stereotyped
affair, a furtive irregularity, a silly little
sin. The seduction of the middle classes was a
monotonous business, popular only by reason of
the danger it entailed. It has remained for our
modern world to raise it to a place of dignity
among the leading interests of all society.</p>

<h1 id='modern'>THIS MODERN WORLD</h1>

<p>What are the reasons for this recent tendency?
There are many answers. In the first place, mankind
need no longer turn the whole of its energy
to defence and sustenance. The life of the average
man is not completely devoted to his business.
He is a rarely active person if one-third of his day
is given over to actual work.</p>

<p>He reads, he plays, sometimes he wages war,
and for the rest of the time he sleeps, eats and
makes love. We find ourselves in a restless age,
a time of experiment; when almost everyone is
urged by the same desire to revise and improve.</p>

<p>It is the Golden Age of good living, consequently
it is the age of impending boredom. In
such an atmosphere we would expect to find a development
of parlour pastimes. These conditions,
this pleasant leisure, this much vaunted, generally
diffused prosperity, this impatience for hallowed
tradition and the time-honoured devices for improving
one’s time, have given rise to crossword
puzzles, introspection, and modern seduction.</p>

<h2 id='t449'>DIFFICULTIES OF RESEARCH</h2>

<p>Since the connotation of the word has been altered,
I venture to assert that there have been
converted to the practices of seduction at least
twice as many devotees as had flourished before.
This statement will undoubtedly be challenged:
once more, I make no doubt, the skeptical will object
to my conclusions on the grounds that a scientific
recluse is of necessity withdrawn from the
world and its customs and is thus automatically
excluded as a responsible judge of sociological
problems. It might be appropriate in this preface
to enter a plea for our great body of research
workers who are submitted to this sort of amateur
criticism. The path of the scientist is beset with
difficulties of every nature; not only those in the
natural line of his work, but the wholesale
hostility of the uninformed layman who does not understand
the hardships and delays of laboratory
procedure. In this case I hope to forestall criticism
by claiming to have followed a conscientious
program of newspaper reading. My statement
is based on the knowledge common to the layman.
I cite as proof the columns of the newspapers, both
the items of fact and the syndicated columns which,
it would appear, devote seventy-five per cent of
their space to discussion of the present generation
and what to do about it.</p>

<p>Indeed other students of society have gone
farther, much farther. Dr. Henry W. Gardner,
eminent social psychologist, seven years ago devoted
his doctor’s thesis to the so-called conditions
of morality then prevailing on the “campus.” With
highly commendable enthusiasm, this scholar spent
almost the entire school year in an alder bush that
grew on the edge of a secluded path known to irreverent
minds as Lover’s Lane, where the youths
of the university were wont to take their evening
strolls. He adduced the following significant statistics:</p>

<p>Of the 3,061 automobiles that drove through
the lane in one week, 2,009 stopped, and 2,005
turned off the motors. Of these, 154 drove on
again after periods of time varying to an upper
limit of five minutes. Of the remainder, 1,788
parked for periods of not less than one hour and
not more than two hours and three-quarters. Dr.
Gardner ascribed the fixation of these limits to
the period between the beginning of darkness
(which of course varied with the season) and the
“coeds’” curfew.</p>

<p>Of the remaining sixty-three, forty-nine of the
automobiles spent the entire night in the lane.
The fate of the other fourteen will never be
known: they were all still there on the historic
night when a watchman stumbled over Dr. Gardner’s
feet and took him to jail before he could
explain. The vicissitudes and obstacles that stand
in the scientist’s way cannot be overestimated.
This deplorable incident is merely one example
of the prevalent attitude.</p>

<p>Another of his experiments was to fix a dictaphone
beneath the old oak bench at the far end
of Lover’s Lane. He did this shortly after the
unfortunate episode of the jail, and for eleven
nights he was thus enabled to sit at his ease in
the laboratory, taking notes. (I myself have
much reason to thank and commend Dr. Gardner’s
foresight: these notes, while they have not
been used as source material, have nevertheless
allowed me to corroborate many of my own
conclusions.)</p>

<h2 id='t526'>METHOD OF TREATMENT</h2>

<p>The method used in this treatise is the result
of much thought. After attempting several other
outlines, I have come to the conclusion that the
most graphic representation is that of hypothetical
cases for each lesson—i.e., each chapter represents
a typical case, or synthetic experience. The
student may at first glance object to this treatment,
but a short survey will, I hope, convince him that
the system is the only adequate one possible. Note
that each experiment is couched in colloquial terms,
the better to carry the atmosphere of the lesson.
Of course the student is expected to vary the program
according to his own requirements: these
experiments are to serve merely as outlines. I
have attempted to avoid as far as possible that
wealth of technical terminology so dear to the
heart of the average scientific author and so trying
to the beginner: I have dared to hope that
my compilation would be an aid not only to that
small band who have dedicated their lives exclusively
to research, but also to the great masses,
the dilettantes and amateurs who might be able
to find some inspiration in these pages.</p>

<p>The preparation, both research and field work,
has been arduous, but what accomplishment was
ever valuable without some labour and pains? If
my contribution to scientific literature has in some
small measure advanced the penetration of my
fellow man and eased his path of loving, I am
amply repaid.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to thank those who have
worked with me. Without their unfailing patience,
sympathy and assiduity this little book could
never have been written.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Well-to-do man with slightly artistic tendencies;
the sort that believes first in money,
then in full enjoyment of it. His philosophy
is practical but not too limited to
material considerations; in other words, he
talks well on almost any subject.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='it'>SUBJECT:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Slightly younger, but of the same breed.
The families of the two protagonists have
probably been friendly for two generations.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='it'>APPARATUS:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>A restaurant: one of the more leisurely
ones where the dishes do not rattle but an
orchestra makes conversation just as difficult.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='it'>REMARKS:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>The keynote of the approach is a tacit appreciation
of intelligence on the part of the
subject. This sympathetic attitude is very
important. Think it all over carefully, put
a flower in your buttonhole and go ahead.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT CAPACITY FOR LIVING</p>

<p>You have reached the coffee and are putting up
a brave fight against the orchestra before going
out into the privacy of the street.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> And we didn’t get home, after all, until
two o’clock. I was so angry: it spoiled the evening.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Angry! I don’t think that you could
ever be angry.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Oh, yes, you don’t know me at all. I
have a <span class='it'>dreadful</span> temper.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, it doesn’t somehow fit in with my
idea of you, you see. No, I must disagree with
you. You haven’t a temper. It’s impossible for
you to have a really earthly emotion.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (somewhat irritated):</span> Why, how can you
say such a thing?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You’re a strangely aloof child, you know.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (after a pleased little silence):</span> That’s
not nice of you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Why not? It’s so nice of you, you know.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Oh, do you really think so? I’m sure
I don’t try to be. No.... (<span class='it'>with a charming
smile</span>)—you’re quite wrong. It’s the rest of
them that are different. I’m really very normal.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Normal? Oh, my dear! And yet, after
all, it’s not very funny. Perhaps it’s a tragedy.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> What is?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Your attitude toward life.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Why, I have no attitude!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> There you are; that’s just it. Someone
of us mortals tries to tell you how we—how
flesh-and-blood
beings react to you, and you simply
open those clear eyes of yours, and—well, how
can I go on talking in the face of such bland ignorance?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Ignorance! Why I don’t....</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh, surely you know how ignorant you
are? You must remain ignorant with deliberation.
It’s part of your charm, of course, but ... oh,
how charming you could be, in another way!</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Really.... (<span class='it'>suddenly her voice warms
and she leans a little over the table, talking
eagerly</span>) No, you’re perfectly right. I mean from
your viewpoint, of course. One thing that you
forget, though, is that I don’t feel the way that
you and the rest of them do. I can’t really understand
it myself, and yet ... oh, all that sort
of thing; emotion and all that; seems so ... so
messy.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Messy? My dear child, what sort of
people can you have known?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Perfectly normal people, I assure you.
No, it’s my own fault. It’s me, and I can’t help
it. Emotion to me has always seemed—no thank
you, just demi-tasse—seemed common. Not aristocratic.
That’s rather a snide thing to say, isn’t
it? I don’t mean to sound that way.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I know you don’t. (<span class='it'>The music plays
without competition for a moment</span>). But how
sad!</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Sad? Oh no. I get along quite well.
I’m really very happy, except once in a while.
I’m as happy, that is, as you can possibly be for
all your—your normality.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> But what a strange way for an intelligent
person like yourself to think! Have you no
curiosity?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Oh, certainly. To an extent. But when
curiosity conflicts with one’s disgusts....</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Disgusts? Now you are certainly
wrong. It gives you away.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes, that was a silly thing to say.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Don’t you think that you allow your
mind to rule you too much? It’s really dangerous.
I mean it. Surely your intelligence tells you that
a well-rounded personality....</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> But I told you; I don’t want to experiment!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I can’t believe that you are in a position
to judge. You don’t really know what you want;
you don’t know what to want. I don’t believe you
for a minute when you say you are happy. Lovely,
yes; but lovely in a melancholy way. How can
you know about yourself, you wise child? Tell
me, are you always so serene?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You’re getting much too serious. Let’s
dance.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t want to dance with you just now.
I think you’re trying to run away from me as you
have always run away from questions. Do you
know, you’re a most deceptive person. When I
met you, I said to myself, “She is sensitive,” but
I never thought of you as being beautiful. I’m
being frank, do you mind? But I see now that you
are. I see that you are rarely beautiful, but that
you do not wish to be. Isn’t that true?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Why no, of course not. I don’t understand
it all.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> It’s just this, and I don’t care whether
or not I offend you. In fact, I hope I do. Someone
ought to offend you now and then. You’re
committing a crime, not only against us but against
yourself. If I had my way—and I’m not being
selfish, either—</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (blazing):</span> As though any of you weren’t
selfish!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I’m so tired of it all. Don’t you think
I hear something like this every day of my life?
All of you working for yourselves, arguing for
yourselves, talking eternally about the same thing.
I can’t stand any more of it. I’m sick of it.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You (gravely):</span> I beg your pardon, but you’re
not being quite polite, are you? You’re a bit unjust.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Perhaps I’m rather excited. Sorry.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Perhaps not. This is the result of a
long silence, isn’t it? You have never spoken like
this before?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes, that’s it.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You (leaning forward):</span> My dear, if I’ve said
anything....</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (faintly):</span> No, it’s nothing. Tell me, how
can you—all of you—be so cold blooded and
unfastidious at the same time?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh, but you are wrong. I’m sure that
as a rule we are more fastidious than you could
possibly know. I’m sorry that I’ve disturbed
you—Check, please! I’m going to take you home.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, I was foolish. You’re right. I’m
sure you’re right. But I couldn’t help it. Have
I hurt you?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Let’s forget it all. Let’s go somewhere
and talk about other things. (<span class='it'>You rise and start
to the door.</span>) I didn’t want to spoil the evening,
much as you seemed to think so. Should we go
to my place and look at the print I just bought?
It’s so early to take you home.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes, that would be nice.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> There, you see; I’ve done you an injustice.
You’re quite human underneath it all.
Probably someone has hurt you, and you won’t
tell me about it. I think, my dear, that you have
a very great capacity for living. Let’s take one

<p><span class='it'>REMARKS:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>The inclusion in the collection of this lesson
is accompanied by some misgivings on
my part. It is a method of which we do
not approve. The true seduction does not
depend upon mechanical devices such as alcohol.
I counsel my students to save this
method until all else fails, for it leads to a
slackness and a lazy attitude toward the
work. Moreover, it is against the law in
this country to buy liquor or to carry it
around.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>JUST ANOTHER LITTLE ONE</p>

<p>1. The introduction. Give everyone full notice,
but when her name is mentioned, employ the
personal touch in your bow—the lingering glance
shading off in friendly admiration.</p>

<p>2. Wait half an hour, perhaps employing the
time with a drink. Dance with everyone else and
be looking at her twice when she glances your way.</p>

<p>3. Suddenly walking over to her, you should
look accusingly at the half-full glass in her hand.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me that’s your first?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Say, who are you anyway? Have I ever seen
you around?”</p>

<p>“No, Joe and Edna brought me. I don’t know
anyone here very well.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Joe?”</p>

<p>“The little fellow over there.”</p>

<p>“Your heavy?”</p>

<p>“Silly! No, of course not. He and Edna just
got married. That’s why they’re having this
party, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I was invited, that’s all I know.
Well, see you later.”</p>

<p>Get up and go away at this point; too much at
first is too much.</p>

<p>4. Soon after this it is likely that the lady will
finish her glass mechanically; and the next one will
go down with more alacrity. Keep an eye on her,
and when she has finished the second one come
back and ask her to dance. If you are a good
dancer the whole thing is easier, but so few of you
are.</p>

<p>Put her down when it is over, smile at her politely
and go away again. This mystifies her.</p>

<p>5. Two drinks later. Don’t drink too much;
this requires as much concentration as any other
business. It’s time now to focus the attack.</p>

<p>After two or three dances the room seems
uncomfortably warm, and now that she is accustomed
to being monopolized she won’t be averse
to stepping outdoors with you to get cool. Any
car will do if it is unoccupied.</p>

<p>There will be a slightly awkward pause; breathless
and afraid on her part. Then she realizes
that your intentions are all right and she is
ashamed of her own suspicions.</p>

<p>“My, but it must have been warm in there,”
she says. “I didn’t realize it. What a lovely night!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, the gang’s crazy to stay indoors in this
weather.... Say, what do you do all the time?
I haven’t seen you around.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t been in town very long. I’m
visiting Edna.”</p>

<p>“Having a good time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Everyone’s been so nice to me.”</p>

<p>“Naturally they would be, to you. I guess you
have a pretty good time wherever you go.”</p>

<p>“Aw, that’s an old one!”</p>

<p>“You don’t swallow everything you hear, do
you? Well, that’s right.” ... a burst of music
comes through the window ... “Say, I’ve got a
drink or two here. Want one?”</p>

<p>“Oh no—I’ve had enough. But you go right
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Nope, I don’t drink without company.”</p>

<p>“Well—just a little one.”</p>

<p>6. After the bottle has been tucked away
again, settle down with a deep sigh and put your
arm around her. While she’s wondering if she
ought to let it stay there, turn around and pull
her head over to yours, very lazily and comfortably.</p>

<p>“No! Please.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Release her, avoiding all trace of petulance.
She can think that over for a while.</p>

<p>7. After a long time, reach for the bottle
again.</p>

<p>“Just another little one?”</p>

<p>Of course she doesn’t want to be a complete
prig—</p>

<p>“All right. But aren’t you drinking a lot?”</p>

<p>“No. I never take too much.”</p>

<p>There really isn’t much to say. You don’t want
conversation; she knows you don’t. She does—or
does she? She doesn’t know what she wants,
just now. You’ve flustered her and upset her and
started her thinking and you aren’t doing anything
to help her out. She wonders why you don’t say
something. She can’t think of anything to say.
She’s thinking too hard of something which you
have evidently forgotten. It is almost a relief
when you put your arm around her again. Something
definite, anyway. Even when you kiss her
she doesn’t protest. She thinks that it wasn’t bad
anyway; in fact it was a nice kiss—not too long
nor too enthusiastic.</p>

<p>And as a matter of fact, this particular subject
should not be a connoisseur of kisses. She would
like to discuss it. Whenever she has been kissed
before, the occasion seemed more momentous,
with prelude of conversation and aftermath of
protestation. Your absolute indifference intrigues
her. You’ve evidently forgotten all about it already.</p>

<p>8. And then you yawn. Yawn and burrow
your head in her breast in an affectionate, friendly
manner; dropping off to sleep immediately. She
sits very still and straight, hoping that you’ll wake
up, hoping you won’t, hoping no one is watching
you from the porch, wondering why she isn’t objecting,
wondering why she should, wondering
about life in general.... It’s all because she drank
so much of that whiskey. She really doesn’t feel
so well. Sort of mixed up. Why don’t you wake
up? She wants to go in and dance; it must be late.
How did this get started anyway?</p>

<p>9. She stirs a little at last, for her arm is
going to sleep, and this wakes you. Open your
eyes and pull her face down to yours—it’s the
most natural thing to do under the circumstances.
“Sweet thing.”</p>

<p>She is reassured. You are thinking of her, then.
You’ve become once more a person, a man, instead
of an abstract problem. And she knows
how to deal with people, even with men. It’s this
other thing that worries her; this horrible impersonal
wondering; this feeling of enmity that lurks
in the air when people forget you and go to sleep.
Although she couldn’t put it into words....</p>

<p>10. “Another drink, sweet thing?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“Sure, just another little one now.”</p>

<p>She isn’t thinking at all now. If she were she’d
probably suggest going in, for it is late and she
wants to dance. But it doesn’t seem late; it
doesn’t seem as though time is going on at all.
She isn’t thinking. She doesn’t start to think even
when you kiss her more enthusiastically and not so
lazily. This must be the way a plant feels on a
hot summer day when it hasn’t anything to do but
grow. Not happy; not sad.</p>

<p>It is only when she realized at last that you are
growing importunate that she stirs herself and
protests. She isn’t sure what to say; the protest
is more a matter of habit than anything
else.... Everything
is a habit.... And once more, for the
last time, you say “Yes. One more. Just another
little one.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>We all have some primitive instincts, even
now. A crude exhibition of brute strength
is fascinating to most of us, deny it as we
will. The psychological basis for the reaction
of the subject is probably a feeling
that she will not have to bear the responsibility
for whatever may happen.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>FEEL MY MUSCLE</p>

<p>The holiday crowd is thinning out. Dusk
shrouds the less decorative elements of the
beach—the
ragged holes left by children and the empty,
soiled paper lunch boxes. Those revelers who
are left see only the long curving line of the shore
and a mysterious intermittent foaming as the lazy
waves crash slowly against the sand.</p>

<p>Eloise lounges on the beach, watching the slow
ebb of the Sunday gaiety. She thinks vaguely of
going in for one more dip before she gets dressed;
thinks of the shock of cold water on her already-dry
bathing suit; thinks of the damp, dank-smelling
dressing-room, and decides to postpone
the whole thing for a few minutes. There is no
hurry and she isn’t cold. She runs her hand
through her fuzzy hair and yawns. She is a slim
girl with a slightly bored expression, and she is
younger than she looks.</p>

<p>It has been a pleasant Sunday, withal rather
dull. She hasn’t come to the beach alone; she and
the other file-clerk in the office have ventured out
together. But Bessie has met up with a boy-friend
and disappeared. Eloise does not hold a grudge
against her for her desertion; it is understood that
such accidents are likely to happen on Sunday
afternoon. But she surveys the long lonely ride
home with distaste. She chews her wad of Juicy
Fruit dreamily and gives to the ukelele clutched to
her diaphragm a pensive plunk.</p>

<p>It is at this moment that you sight her. You are
strolling along the beach on your way in, after an
arduous day of life-saving. Not that anyone has
needed his life saved, but three blondes and two
brunettes have required swimming lessons and all
of them have been plump. By this time you prefer
them slender; all the ladies tattooed on your
arms are very slender indeed; and two of them
wear red bathing-suits of the same shade as
Eloise’s. You stop short when you see her and
wonder if you haven’t seen her before somewhere.
You decide that you haven’t; and regret the fact.
You wonder if she has noticed you. If she has,
she doesn’t show it. Not a missed beat has interrupted
the mastication of her chewing-gum.</p>

<p>True to your vocation, adopt a nautical
method of approach. In other words, tack. First
walk along a line inclined at forty-five degrees to
the most direct approach to Eloise. Somewhere
at her right pause suddenly and examine a sand-crab.
Then look up quickly, obviously under the
impression that someone is calling you. After
carefully looking at everything else on the beach,
drop your eyes to Eloise, who blinks and turns
away.</p>

<p>Sigh loudly and drop heavily and prone on the
sand near her feet. Startled, she looks at you
again. Grin and flip a pebble at her.</p>

<p>“Say!” says Eloise, indignantly.</p>

<p>“What do you say, girlie?” you counter. Then
raise yourself in sections and redrape your lean
length on the log next to her. “Ain’t you lonesome?”
you add.</p>

<p>It is a rhetorical question purely, but she does
not want to play. She chooses to take you literally.</p>

<p>“Not much,” she retorts. “I’m waiting for a
guy.”</p>

<p>Answer promptly, “Not any more, you ain’t.”</p>

<p>She compresses her lips and ignores you, fingering
the strings of the ukelele in an abstracted
way. It has no effect. Pat her arm and say:</p>

<p>“Give us a tune, kid?”</p>

<p>“Fresh!” she says scornfully. “Who you
crowding?”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t be mean,” you plead. “Give us a
tune.”</p>

<p>Eloise shakes her head quickly and decisively.
“I didn’t ask you over!” she reminds you. It is
a warning that she is on her guard; that she is a
difficult proposition; that she is a Nice Girl.</p>

<p>“Well, gee, can’t a guy try to be human?” Your
voice should be petulant and youthful. “I was
just trying to be human. I was lonesome.” It
is a plaintive speech, and you look plaintive. But
nevertheless you are a masculine being, strong and
undefeated. Probably it is the bathing suit, or
perhaps the air with which you light your cigarette.
Eloise gazes at your profile in uncertainty.
End the pause by casting away the match and
turning to her.</p>

<p>“So when I seen you I couldn’t help talking.
If you don’t like it I’ll go away. I got my pride,
too.”</p>

<p>This is a little better. “Oh, well, if you didn’t
mean to be fresh. You know a girl has got to
be careful.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” you say, nodding. “I bet <span class='it'>you</span> do, all
right.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Aw, you know what I mean!” say to her ardently.
“Anybody ever tell you your eyes are
pretty?”</p>

<p>“Fresh!” She starts picking at the ukelele
again, slightly confused.</p>

<p>“Come on now, babe,” you plead again. “Give
us a tune.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything new,” she apologizes
in advance. “Do you know that one ‘I Can’t Give
You Anything But Love’?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” you murmur.</p>

<p>She plays the song, and then another, and another.
The sun approaches the horizon and the
ocean turns dark and green.</p>

<p>“Gee,” says Eloise in low tones, “I got to go.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, babe.” Stand up and rumple
her hair affectionately before leaving. Eloise
shrouds herself in her bathrobe and waits. Presently
you come back through the night, carrying
two hot-dogs dripping mustard.</p>

<p>“Surround that,” you order, proffering one.
“It’s a swell night. Anybody worrying about
you? You cold?”</p>

<p>She shakes her head hesitantly. “N-no. But
I’ll have to go soon; it’s awfully late.”</p>

<p>You munch hungrily while the breeze dies down
over the water. Then shift, disposing yourself
more comfortably, and grunt contentedly. Eloise
gives the head in her lap a little push, but it rolls
back. She decides to ignore it.</p>

<p>“Gosh,” you say at last, “a night like this is
enough to make anybody feel soft. Even a guy
like me.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I bet you’re a hard guy!” she cries.</p>

<p>Lift your head and prop it on your hand. “Say,
listen, babe! Anybody who says I ain’t, don’t
know me! Does anybody ever bother you? Some
of these drugstore sheiks ever get fresh?”</p>

<p>She hangs her head. “Well....”</p>

<p>“Well,” cut her short, “if they do, send ’em
around!” Make your voice ominous. “Don’t let
anybody tell you different. Look here.” Raise
your arm and clench your fist. “Feel that. There.”</p>

<p>Eloise puts out a tentative and timid finger.
“Ooo!” she cries. “Yes, I guess you <span class='it'>could</span> hit. I
guess I wouldn’t ever try to get <span class='it'>you</span> sore!”</p>

<p>“Baby,” murmur tenderly, “you couldn’t get
me sore if you tried. I knew the minute I seen
you you was a sweet kid. If anybody ever bothers
you again, tell me. A nice kid like you hadn’t
ought to go around without somebody taking care
of you. I remember once....” Here you stop.
Somewhere down the beach another ukelele plays
softly. You sigh and grope through the dark.
She tries futilely to dislodge you.</p>

<p>“I really got to be going,” she protests, somewhat
frightened. She is always somewhat frightened
when the fellows get too fresh.</p>

<p>“Now listen, babe. You ain’t afraid of me,
You needn’t be. Don’t go away yet; you’re all
right. Just a little longer.” And yet, as before,
for all your pleading tones there should be a hint
of strength in your speech. Eloise yields, but
whether to your imploring or your strength she
does not know.</p>

<p>“Well,” she says, “if you’re nice.”</p>

<p>Silence lives on the beach, except for the tiny
wailing of the ukelele. Silently the water undulates
and the moon creeps over the edge of it.</p>

<p>“Quit it!” says Eloise, giggling nervously. Do
not answer. “Aw, quit!” Still you do not answer.
“Please! You’re too strong. Oh, quit!”</p>

<p>The other ukelele still plays, spreading over the
night a sweet layer of romance; singing of exotic
love on a whiter, warmer beach in a more delicate
world; singing of love, as though love were a thing
to be sung.</p>

<p>The doorbell rings just as she is settling down
to a nap, and there is no one else in the house to
answer it. She opens the door a little reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Arthur,” she says in relief. “Come
in. I thought it might be someone special.”</p>

<p>“I’m not interrupting anything, am I?” say,
smiling as you enter the living room. Smile nicely;
youthfully. “I won’t go away, at any rate. Not
unless you’re very hard and cruel. I worked too
hard to get here.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she says, sitting down and patting
her hair in back. “I was going to lie down
and try to sleep, out of sheer boredom. There’s
nothing I really have to do. But you should be
at work. Why aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t feel like working.” Frown and look
at her defiantly. “Good Lord, why should a man
work all the time? I hate the bloody office anyway,
and you know it.”</p>

<p>She shakes her head at you, but smiles. “I
ought to scold you. But I know too well how you
feel.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you lie down even if I am here?
Go on over to the chaise-longue; I’ll tuck your
feet up.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” she cries. “You’ll have me spoiled
if you’re too attentive. Bob hasn’t your touching
respect for my age.”</p>

<p>Thump the chair as you bend over to arrange
the quilt. “Alice, that isn’t funny. It never was
funny. At any rate, you mustn’t tell Bob how nice
I am to you, or his dislike of me will overflow all
bounds. That would be a nuisance. I’d have
to visit you in the afternoons all the time, and they
wouldn’t like that at the damned office.”</p>

<p>“No, and you wouldn’t ever get to see my new
dinner dress.”</p>

<p>Sit down on the edge of the chair. “And I’d
have to stay away on week-ends; I’d have to start
playing golf, and I hate it. It’s much nicer to
come here and talk.”</p>

<p>She laughs. “Yes, I know you think so. You’d
rather talk than do anything else, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you?” you counter. “But this sub
rosa arrangement might have its advantages. If
I had to be furtive you might be forced to take
me seriously.”</p>

<p>“You’re a silly little boy,” she says, looking
worried.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. I only wish you said it
oftener. If you would only promise me to say
every morning and every evening ‘What a silly
boy Arthur is,’ I’d feel better about going home
so often.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a difficult promise to make,”
she says thoughtfully. “Perhaps I do it anyway.
You’re awfully silly sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Good! At any rate, that would mean that
you would say my name twice a day.”</p>

<p>“Heavens!”</p>

<p>“It did sound sentimental, didn’t it? Well, forget
it. You know, I am serious about Bob: I
wish he’d dislike me a little more actively.”</p>

<p>She sits up and speaks with decision. “Arthur!
You know well enough that Bob doesn’t dislike
you at all.”</p>

<p>“Is that it?” you ask, sorrowfully. “Then it’s
his maddening indifference that I can’t forgive
him. I won’t forgive him, anyway, so you might
as well give up.”</p>

<p>“If it would make you feel any better, he said
just the other evening, ‘Why doesn’t that kid get
to work? He’s been hanging around here a lot
longer than he would if I were his father.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” you answer, “that helps. That helps.
I feel almost kindly toward him now. I’m glad
you told me.”</p>

<p>“You know well enough you like Bob!”</p>

<p>Shake your head. “It’s just another of my
worries. I do like Bob. I love Bob. He’s such
a child.”</p>

<p>She giggles. “Well, I wish he could hear you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it funny? We go around feeling
paternal about each other and you lie there and
laugh at both of us. Let’s not talk about him any
more. I’m not a sub rosa visitor yet; I haven’t
any right to talk. Where’s Betty?”</p>

<p>“I sent her out to the Park for the afternoon.”
She looks out of the window. “We’ve had such
wretched weather until today. She’ll be heartbroken
when she finds out you were here. Now
that the family’s all discussed and taken care of,
tell me how you are. Have you been doing anything
wicked lately? Tell me some gossip about
the younger generation.”</p>

<p>“What do I know about the younger generation?
I haven’t been playing around. It’s queer
restless weather. I’ve been trying to write. I’m
surprised you haven’t noticed this air. There’s
something in it. Even you must have noticed.
It isn’t exactly wild. Spiritually provocative, I
think—whatever that means.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I have noticed it?” she asks.</p>

<p>“You!” you cry bitterly. “A sublimely wise
person like you? Alice dearest, why should you
have noticed it? Or if you did, why should you
admit it?”</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows, somewhat surprised.
“You sound angry,” is all she says. “What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m in a bad temper.”</p>

<p>“You really are,” she says wonderingly. “I’ve
never seen you like this. Won’t you tell me what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for God’s sake! Why won’t you get
angry? Why won’t you tell me to get out?”</p>

<p>“Arthur, what is the matter?” She speaks
gently.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d get angry, just once. I’d like
to fight and fight with you. I’d like to make you
cry. I could, too, if I only knew how to begin.”</p>

<p>She looks at you in silence. Then go on—“Sit
up, Alice! Sit up and slap me. Stop looking so
damned comfortable. You don’t really feel
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“But I do,” she protests. “I’m sorry, but I
do.” It is funny, but she doesn’t laugh.</p>

<p>“No you aren’t. You’re sure enough of yourself;
you’re secure, but you don’t like all this any
more than I do.”</p>

<p>“All what?”</p>

<p>“All—all that you don’t like. Why can’t you
tell me? I keep hoping you will, but you never
do. Why can’t you tell me? I tell you everything.
You have every bit of me. You make me
tell you everything and then you never give anything
back.”</p>

<p>“Arthur!” she cries, hurt.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it.” Lean closer to her startled
face. “There’s just one thing I really want. Just
one. The one thing I’ll never get from you.”</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me the truth. To look at
me and say, ‘Arthur, I don’t really like this at all.
I hate this house. I hate being smooth and perfect.
I hate my mother for what she did to me,
making me like this—’”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she cries.</p>

<p>“‘And I hate my daughter for what I am
making of her. I hate her when she looks like
her father—’”</p>

<p>“No! No!”</p>

<p>“‘And I want to die when I realize that I
am getting more and more like all of them, all the
time.’ Go on, Alice. Say it.”</p>

<p>She shakes her head slowly, and weeps. “I
can’t.”</p>

<p>“Say it!” you repeat. “I—Alice, I made you
cry, didn’t I? Never mind. Say it.”</p>

<p>“No. The one thing you can never——” she
cries convulsively.</p>

<p>“What is it, dearest?”</p>

<p>“You said it yourself,” she sobs. “The one
thing you can never have. I won’t. I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Stop crying, dearest. Please. I can’t hear
you when you talk like that. Darling, darling,
I’m so sorry I made you cry. I’m so glad. Kiss
me. You must, darling. It’s the only other thing
to do. Alice, you know it is. Kiss me. If you
won’t talk.... We must, dear.”</p>

<p>This lesson is relegated to the use of the
kiddies; it is good for very little else. In
this day of experience and the single standard
it is passé, and I include it more as a
curiosity than anything else. The beginner
should know the fundamental principles, at
any rate. For older participants in the
game who wish to try their luck along these
lines, I suggest more restraint. A few dark
hints will go farther than any amount of
explicit description. The imagination of an
innocent girl can work wonders with a very
slight encouragement.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>I’M BAD</p>

<p>“But it <span class='it'>is</span> different,” says the little girl, with
an eager note in her voice. You give up the argument
for a time and sit in silence, hearing only the
creaking of the porch swing’s chain above the
noises of the summer night.</p>

<p>She takes up the conversation again.</p>

<p>“I mean that supposing I should want to do
all those things—some girls do, you know—well,
I couldn’t. Of course it isn’t likely I should want
to. I don’t see any fun in hanging on to the under
part of a train——”</p>

<p>“Riding the blinds,” you say, patiently.</p>

<p>“All right; riding the blinds. But there might
be something. Like—like staying up all night,
perhaps, when it isn’t New Year’s. Bob used to
do that. Mother didn’t think it was particularly
terrible if he just said he was studying, but I can’t
even do that. It isn’t fair. Here I am a senior
in high school and practically grown up and they’ll
always treat me like a baby just because I’m a
girl.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” say, as she stops for breath, “it’s a
shame.” And this is as far as your sympathy
goes. After all there isn’t much else to say.
Nevertheless she feels slightly resentful.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to be so satisfied about it,” she
says.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied. Only I don’t know what I’m
supposed to do about it. I think myself you girls
are pretty darned lucky. A man has to look out
for himself, and believe me sometimes it isn’t so
much fun as you think.”</p>

<p>“Well, even if——”</p>

<p>“No, you can say things like that for hours, but
you can’t really tell until you have to try it. Why,
I’d just like to see you in some of those situations.”</p>

<p>She is really impressed.</p>

<p>“What situations?”</p>

<p>“Aw, I couldn’t tell you. A fellow couldn’t
really talk about some of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on! I wouldn’t tell anyone!”</p>

<p>“You bet you wouldn’t! What if I told you
that I was caught in a Raid?”</p>

<p>“Really? You’re not kidding? What kind of
a raid?”</p>

<p>“Why, a—a Raid. There’s just one kind. The
cops come in and pretty soon the music stops
and——”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“’Xpect me to tell? Oh, well, then—Place
called the Yellow Mill.”</p>

<p>“Oo, gee! Were you alone?”</p>

<p>“Was I alone! Don’t be such a dumb-bell. Of
course I wasn’t alone. Do you suppose a fellow
goes to those cabarets alone? Why, they wouldn’t
let him in!”</p>

<p>“Then who was with you?”</p>

<p>“What girls? Anyone in school?”</p>

<p>“Maybe and maybe not.”</p>

<p>“Honest? Then it was. I’ll bet it was
Eleanor.”</p>

<p>“Well, it just wasn’t. What do you think
Eleanor is? A man wouldn’t take a NICE girl
to the Yellow Mill.”</p>

<p>“Why—why Walter, you don’t know any other
kind, do you?”</p>

<p>“Say, don’t judge everybody by yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well—what happened?”</p>

<p>“I told you what happened. The cops came in
and the music stopped and some of the girls sort
of screamed and then the cops started looking for
booze.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any?”</p>

<p>“Well of course we <span class='it'>had</span> had some, but by the
time——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter!”</p>

<p>“Gosh, don’t you think a fellow has to have a
drink sometimes? By the time they came we had
finished it.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t know the difference if I told you.
It was wine. Elmer got it from his old man.”</p>

<p>“Elmer Busby?”</p>

<p>“Nevermind. Well——”</p>

<p>“It was!”</p>

<p>“Well, what if it was? Do you want to hear
about this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep quiet. Well, there wasn’t any left
when the cop came over to us, so he couldn’t prove
anything. He just looked at us and said ‘All right.
Outside!’”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Why—then we went home.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d have been scared to death.”</p>

<p>“Sure you would. Any girl would have been.”</p>

<p>She sighs and looks out over the front lawn.</p>

<p>“Maybe I wouldn’t have been scared, though.
Maybe——”</p>

<p>“Sure you would have!”</p>

<p>“No, wait a minute. Maybe it would be fun to
be scared sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d think so, myself, but a girl wouldn’t.
A nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Why, Walter! What a thing to say!”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean it. Look at the way all of you
act—‘Oh, no, it wouldn’t be right—do you think
we ought to?’”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“You. That’s just what you said the other
night after the party when I tried——”</p>

<p>“Well, really, Walter, I don’t see what that has
to do with raids.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Just because I didn’t let you kiss me?”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like kissing.”</p>

<p>“You just don’t care. You never do let me kiss
you. You don’t know anything about it. That’s
the way girls are. No wonder you never have any
fun.”</p>

<p>“Walter, I think you’re really bad.”</p>

<p>“Sure I’m bad! I have a good time. You
don’t.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. But I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“You’re afraid. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Walter, I guess——” she stops.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I guess you can kiss me once. Don’t tell anybody.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“There now. What did you think?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t like it. It was horrid. If you tell
anybody I’ll never speak to you again.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, try it again. I won’t tell anybody.
Come on! What do you think I am? Sure I
won’t tell anybody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter, I bet you think I’m terrible.”
“Of course I don’t. Don’t be a dumb-bell.”
A sudden voice calls from the house.</p>

<p>“Willa! Willa, it’s ten-thirty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter, I have to go.”</p>

<p>“Good night. Whatcha crying about? What

<p>Scarcely a girl in the world is trained to be
on her guard against pity. As a rule a
young woman is sure that she is a difficult
proposition because of her knowledge of the
world and its wicked ways. She is looking,
not for weakness, but for strength to combat;
for presumption so that she may step
on it. It does not occur to any normal girl
that she might be taken unawares as an
angel of consolation.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>AN UGLY OLD THING LIKE ME</p>

<p>It is evening, and you are driving home from
dinner in the country. It is a warm summer night
and too early to be going back; you have already
made a remark to that effect. Suddenly you turn
the car into a private-looking road that leads away
from the stream of home-going cars.</p>

<p>“Now what?” she asks.</p>

<p>“I want to show you a place I found once. Are
you in any particular hurry?”</p>

<p>“No. What is this place?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out in a minute.... Here we
are.” The car comes to a stop in a natural sort of
amphitheater, banked by high walls of rock on one
side and well enclosed by shrubbery that is just
becoming impassable with the full foliage of midsummer.</p>

<p>“It’s an old quarry,” explain to her. “Nice,
isn’t it? I suppose in the daytime it’s full of
picnic people, but I like it.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” she answers. There is a silence, and
you both light cigarettes.</p>

<p>“Quiet,” you mutter. In the deep stillness the
air seems full of life. Some animal crashes
through the bushes, but the moonlight is not so
bright as it seemed and you cannot see him. You
sigh, throw your cigarette out onto the ground,
and take the girl into your arms. She does not
resist at first, except to say “Quit! You’ll burn
yourself.” Then she too casts aside her cigarette
and settles down comfortably. But you are too
urgent for her.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” she gasps, sitting up with
some difficulty and putting a careful hand to her
hair. “What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m only human, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, you weren’t acting human.”</p>

<p>“Sorry. Will you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>There is another silence, until she has to object
again.</p>

<p>“Really,” she protests, “I don’t know what’s
the matter with you tonight. You’ve never acted
like this before.”</p>

<p>“I’m terribly sorry, really. I couldn’t stand it
if I thought I’d offended you. We’ve been good
friends; I don’t see why I have to spoil it like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right. I understand.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully sweet, do you know it?”</p>

<p>“Am I really?”</p>

<p>“Much sweeter than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Silly!”</p>

<p>“Ann, I do love you.”</p>

<p>“Well then, give me another cigarette.”</p>

<p>“No, not just now. Please!”</p>

<p>But after a little interlude of quiet, she protests.</p>

<p>“Arthur, listen. You simply must behave. I
don’t feel that way; can’t you see? I like you a
lot, but I just don’t feel that way. You can’t make
me feel that way, either. I’m sorry. I’ll have to
get mad in a minute.”</p>

<p>Don’t answer, but stare gloomily at the steering-wheel.
She is a little worried.</p>

<p>“Arthur, what’s the matter? I wish you
wouldn’t act that way. It makes me feel so mean.
I don’t want to be mean. I just thought it would
be better to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Sigh and pat her hand.</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly right, dear. It’s just like you—honest
even if you’re cruel.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so silly. It isn’t cruel. I can’t help
it if I can’t feel that way. I never feel that way.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“Arthur, you know I like you better than anybody.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell? I don’t usually lie.”</p>

<p>“Nobody likes me.”</p>

<p>“Why, Arthur!” She pulls your head over to
hers and kisses you. “There, silly.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Ann,” say sadly. “Never mind.
You don’t have to. You can always be perfectly
honest with me. I understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do not either!” She is impatient.
“You don’t understand me at all, if you’re going
to sulk like that. Here, kiss me.”</p>

<p>Then bury your face in her neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ann, you’re so sweet and I’m such a mess.
I’m going to take you home. I’ll just make a fool
of myself.”</p>

<p>“Why, Arthur?” she says, gently. “Don’t feel
so badly. I understand.”</p>

<p>“You always understand, dear.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go home while you feel so badly. I
want to be a friend of yours, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. It’s all right. I know all about
it. I don’t blame you.”</p>

<p>“Blame me? For what?”</p>

<p>“For not liking me Like That.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I should have thought of it before.
You’re too sweet; you should have told me.
Then I wouldn’t have bothered you.”</p>

<p>“But Arthur, you don’t bother me! What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Please, Ann, I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“You have to, now. You’ve started. I’ve got
to know. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’m going to take you home.”</p>

<p>“You are not! I won’t go home. You sit right
there and explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, darling, please let me take you home! Of
course I understand. I should have thought of
it right away. An ugly old thing like me....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Arthur!” She cries out in pain. “Arthur,
how could you think of such a thing! Look at
me!”</p>

<p>But don’t. She turns your face toward hers by
gripping your ears. You are crying, and looking
at you she begins to cry too, in pity.</p>

<p>“Arthur, how could you? How could you hurt
me so?”</p>

<p>Put your arm around her and pat her on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Ann. Never mind, old girl, it’s
all right.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me,” she murmurs, from the depths of
your coat-collar.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Please, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to. You don’t feel that way.
You’re just sorry for me.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no! Kiss me!”</p>

<p>Kiss her. She clings to your lips in an ecstasy
of renunciation.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ann!” cry, with a break in your voice.</p>

<p>“What, darling? Never mind. Kiss me again.”</p>

<p>“Ann, you’d better be careful. Really, you’d
better be careful.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, darling.”</p>

<p>“Ann, are you sure you won’t be sorry?”</p>

<p>She doesn’t answer.</p>

<p>“An ugly old thing like me, Ann....” But as
might be expected, she clings to your coat lapel
even harder.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ann, loveliest ... you’re not just sorry
for me?”</p>

<p>Perhaps she shakes her head. You aren’t sure.</p>

<p>“Because, Ann,” you add, in an uncertain voice
from which you try to keep the triumph, “I’m only
human.”</p>

<p>There is no objection.</p>

<p>Most of ardent advocates of social improvement
are the products of conventional
environment. They are inclined to class together
all of the rules of conduct which
they have denounced as part of a deliberate
scheme to slow up the progress of humanity’s
freedom. If you can associate in their
minds the conventional concept of morality
with the mossgrown ideas of property and

<p>Walking home from the meeting of the Social
Science Club, you are more quiet than usual. It is
strange that you should be quiet at all; you aren’t
that type. Both of you love to talk; your intimacy
has grown up in spite of, rather than because of
this tendency. You became acquainted two or
three months before, across the crowded room
of the Communist Club when you both leaped to
your feet to refute some heretical statement by
the speaker of the evening, who had expressed an
unsound and intolerant view concerning Union
rule. You had cried out together in protest,
turned and looked at each other, faltered, and
sat down. Then you both had risen again, even
more precipitately, looked at each other again in
a less amiable manner, and started to speak again.
The crowd laughed. At last she had bowed to
you jerkily and sat down again, leaving the field
to you.</p>

<p>But when she heard what you had to say she did
not dislike you so much. You expressed her views
exactly. To be sure, you did not say all there was
to be said, and when you finished she had to make
several additions. But after the meeting you
waited for each other and took up the thread of
the argument again. You walked five miles that
night and didn’t notice. Ever since then you have
been seeing a good deal of each other, at little
Russian restaurants where each pays his own
check, at concerts where you each firmly buy your
own tickets, and even at her home, where her
family gazes upon you with disfavor and tries to
persuade her to wear a hat when she goes out
with you.</p>

<p>Tonight there is a tension in the air between
you, and you do not know what to do about it.
She has been quarreling with her family and you
have discussed it backwards and forwards and all
around; there was no more to say.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you at all,” repeat for the
twentieth time. “You’re so intelligent about
everything but your own affairs. Can’t you see
that you must attack your own problem with an
impersonal sort of attitude? It’s the only sensible
way to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she answers, gloomily, “but you
don’t understand, exactly. I have to battle against
all the fifteen years that I was under their influence,
besides fighting <span class='it'>them</span>. There’s an element
within myself that I can’t manage. All sorts of
feelings——”</p>

<p>“I know,” sympathetically, “anachronistic ideas
of duty, and filial fondness, and so forth. They
work on all that. Thank God my mother deserted
me when I was a baby. Father’s different.”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky,” she says. “It makes me furious.
After all, I’m of age, and a lot more intelligent
than they’ll ever be.... Well, we’ve said
all that. I’ll just have to let it work itself out.”</p>

<p>“It won’t,” you assure her. “The only way to
settle a thing of this sort is to cut it all off. Why
don’t you go away?”</p>

<p>“How can I?” she says. “I haven’t the moral
courage to hold out against them. I could go
down and live with Marya for a week or so, but
you know what would happen. First Ellen would
walk in and talk to me, pretending to admire me
but holding her skirts away from the furniture
all the time. She’d tell me that Mother hasn’t
been well lately, and then they’d invite me to the
house for dinner and they’d act simply angelic
and rather pitiful, and then I’d come back. I
always do; it’s happened before. I know I’m
weak, but it’s stronger than my intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s one thing I’ll never be able
to understand. How anyone could stand that
house for two hours passes my comprehension,
and you’ve been living there all your life. How do
you do any work?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” she says, simply. “I haven’t really
done anything definite since the last election. You
can’t work any conviction into your speeches if
there are a lot of materialists around all the time.
Oh, I ought to starve! How can I go on pretending
like this?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You’re getting there. There’s
nothing wrong with a person that could get away
from her environment as completely as you have.
But I can see that it’s a struggle.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she says, gratefully. You walk
on in silence.</p>

<p>“Martha,” you say at last, “I know one way
out.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Come with me.”</p>

<p>“With you? But where?”</p>

<p>“Come on home with me. I’ll tell Father that
you’re going to stay there, and that’ll be all there
is to it. He won’t object; he knows better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t,” she says, hastily.</p>

<p>“Why not? It would settle things with your
family. I know that type. They’d never bother
you again; they would cut you off completely.”</p>

<p>She is staggered, and obviously does not know
how to answer.</p>

<p>“You’re a real friend,” she says, at last. “It’s
good of you to offer. But....”</p>

<p>“Not so generous, after all. Certainly I don’t
have to tell you that I love you and all that, do I?
We know better than to waste our time with such
sentimental stuff. But you know that I’d be only
too glad....”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she says, thoughtfully. “Honestly,
I never thought about it. It’s part of my
training, I suppose, but it’s hard to decide to do
a thing like that, right away.”</p>

<p>“Think of it in a sensible way,” you urge. “Try
to throw away those inhibitions. You know well
enough that in the course of time we would be
lovers. Isn’t this better than slinking and being
furtive about it, and fooling your family? I’d hate
it. As a matter of fact, I <span class='it'>have</span> been worrying
about it. This would be such a fine, brave thing
for you to do. Come on, Martha, be independent.
Prove to yourself that you’re something more than
an average female who wants nothing but security.”</p>

<p>“But it’s so difficult,” she says. “You don’t understand.
It would kill Mother.”</p>

<p>“You know it wouldn’t. She might think that
she’s going to die, but she won’t. People don’t
die over such things. And if she did,” you add,
superbly, “she wouldn’t have any right to. No
one has any right to die because someone else lives
up to her convictions.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t help it, somehow,” she says.</p>

<p>“Martha, admit to yourself that it’s the only
thing to do. You can’t go on like this. If you do,
they’ll sell you to some capitalist for a marriage
license and a promise that he’ll leave you money
when he dies. You’ll be part of the same vicious
circle. You can’t play at both of the games,
Martha. If you don’t take your freedom when
you have the chance I’ll have to decide that you’re
insincere.”</p>

<p>She looks very undecided and unhappy. “I
don’t know what’s the matter,” she confesses, “but
I can’t.”</p>

<p>Stop and take her arm. She turns around and
faces you in the dark street. It is very late and
quiet.</p>

<p>“Listen, Martha,” you say gravely, “it’s up to
you. I don’t want to persuade you to do anything
that you don’t really feel you want to do. But I
think that I understand you. You have a beautiful
nature, Martha. You have a splendid mind that
your family weren’t able to spoil. As soon as you
are strong enough to cast off all the deadly conventions
that they’ve tied you with, you’ll be able to
do real things for the world. And yet that isn’t
what I want to say to you now. I respect and admire
you, Martha, and I want you. You want me.
What else is there to this business? Come with
me, Martha, and we’ll work together. Throw
away that background of yours. Step out into the
light.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Michael!” she cries. Your face relaxes,
and you smile.</p>

<p>Say, “There now, let’s do it all, right now. Go
home and get your things. I’ll go with you, if
you like. Then they can do what they want to;
I know you won’t back out.”</p>

<p>Arm in arm, you walk down the street.</p>

Reflection upon this fact
may deter from its use a number of my
students who would regard such an easy
and impersonal victory as an affront to their
pride and self-confidence as first-rate
seducers. It is true that the success of the
method is much more the result of the subject’s
internal conflict than of any remarkable
attributes on the part of the student.
But it is up to the seducer to be there at
the psychological moment to suggest action.
It takes a large amount of tact and self-control

of this suggestion without arousing the suspicions

in wistful romance. Two figures stand in the bow.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Well, home tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Yes. (<span class='it'>Sigh</span>) Back to work.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I do hope it’ll be cooler. But there, it
never does get any cooler until the middle of September
or after, so what’s the use of hoping? I
didn’t have any right running away from the house
this time of the year.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Sure you did. When you first came on
the boat I said to myself, “There’s a little woman
that sure needs a rest.”</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You did! I didn’t know I looked that
bad. The doctor told me to take a rest, but land,
he’s always telling me that.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No, I don’t mean you looked exactly
bad; only sort of thin and pale.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She: (Pleased):</span> Thin! Heavens, I didn’t
know that I ever looked thin. But it isn’t any wonder
I’m pale. Goodness knows I never get out of
the house.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You know, that’s one thing I just can’t
understand about men. The way they let their
wives stay at home. Believe me, if I ever get
married my wife is going to have the best of everything.
And plenty of time to enjoy it, too.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Well, I certainly think your wife’ll be
lucky. But you’ll probably have to wait a long
time to be earning enough. I guess HE doesn’t
have it any too easy himself, working all day in
an office. Sometimes he comes home mighty tired.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Maybe, but don’t you believe he has it
any near as bad as you do. I’ll never forget my
poor old mother slaving day in and day out.
You know what they say—“Man’s work is from
sun to sun; it’s woman’s whole existence” or something
like that. I tell you, I grew up to respect
women, I did.</p>

<p>(There is a pause while you think about it.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (sighing):</span> Well, I certainly like to hear
a man talk like that sometimes. I just wish Joe
could hear you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh, he’d say I didn’t know anything
about it, seeing as I’m not married.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I don’t know. Joe’s awful reasonable.
It was because of him I took this trip. He saw
the ad in the paper and he says “Mary, that’d be
mighty good for you,” he says. And I says, “Yes,
but how would you get along?” He says, “Oh,
I’ll manage.” And now I know that when I look at
that kitchen I’ll just sit down and cry. I do like
a nice clean kitchen. He didn’t even want me to
take the children.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh well, it’s no more than he ought to
do. You’re a mighty nice little woman; I bet
he ought to know it.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Aw!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I bet he don’t know how lucky he is.
Married fellows never do. How long have you
been married anyway?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> That’s a personal question.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Is it? I’m sorry.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Don’t be silly. I’ve been married six
years.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Gee, he must’ve married you out of
high school.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Kidder! (She is pleased.) Well, I
guess I did get married kind of young.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I’ll say you did.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I think it’s better that way, don’t you?
Keeps kids out of mischief.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t know. I almost got married,
but—I always thought maybe I’d better see the
world first.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Maybe the Right One didn’t come along
for you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I guess that was it. Just my luck to find
her when—oh, well.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> What were you going to say?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Wouldn’t it be too bad if she did come
along and I was too late?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> That’s always the way, I guess.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Yes, that’s always the way.</p>

<p>(Another silence.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You’re awful romantic, aren’t you? I’d
know right away you wasn’t a married man.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> That’s funny. It’s just what I would
have said about you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You could tell right away I was married?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No, just the other way around. I said,
“Well, here she is!”</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Here who is?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> And then I saw your wedding-ring.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You know I have a girl friend who always
takes off her ring when she goes to a matinee.
Joe says to me, “Mary if ever a wife of mine did
that I’d give her a good hiding.”</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Yeah? Honest, you’d be surprised at
the number of married women there are that lead
a fellow on.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You bet. You wouldn’t know any like
that, of course; but the way they act there ought
to be a law against it.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I always say if a woman isn’t happy
with her husband she ought to come right out and
say so and get divorced or else not show anybody
the way she feels.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> That’s the right way to look at it. Of
course I guess men don’t make it too easy for you
either. Now me, whenever I’m tempted I just
think of my old mother.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> It depends on the mother too.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Sure.</p>

<p>(A comfortable and agreeing silence, while the
boat glides on through the darkness.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> It sure is nice to meet a woman who can
talk about these things without any—any foolishness.
Oh well. Tomorrow it’ll all be over.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Tomorrow.</p>

<p>(Sigh again and pat her hand on the rail, leaving
your hand over hers when the patting is finished.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Don’t you think people ought to be
broadminded about some things?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I guess so. What things?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh, different things.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Sure.</p>

<p>(Emboldened, you put your arm around her.
She starts away.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, don’t.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> It’s wrong. You ought to be ashamed.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What’s wrong about it? We want to, don’t we?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Say, Joe would kill you if he could hear
you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> He can’t hear me. Aw, be sensible.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I’m being sensible. You’re a nice fellow;
now quit. I’m going in.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No, wait a minute. Just a minute.
You’ve got me all wrong. We’ve been good
friends, haven’t we?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes, we have. I didn’t know you were
going to be like this.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Didn’t you?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (blazing):</span> No, I didn’t! And what’s
more——</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Now, don’t get mad. Don’t get mad.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> What’s more, Joe would kill you! I
told you he’d kill you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> There can’t be any harm in me putting
my arm around you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Sh-h-h!</p>

<p>(The captain passes them in the darkness, muttering
“Nice evening, folks.” She is frightened,
and as you put your arm around her again she
does not object.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What harm could there be in it?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I wish you’d——</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Come on, put your face up.</p>

<p>(Kiss her.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (bursting into tears):</span> I tell you Joe would
kill you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Say, kid, what makes you so sure?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What do you think he’s doing while
you’re away?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Joe? Why—why——</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Oh, be sensible. What did he send you
away for? What do you think men are anyway?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (frightened):</span> You’re wrong; you don’t
know Joe.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Now listen. You know how easy it is
to act this way.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No—I won’t listen to you.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t guess he’s any different from the
rest of us. You been married six years? Say!
Don’t be dumb. Listen; didn’t that schoolmarm
in your cabin get off today?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, no.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Yes she did. I’m coming around to say
good night.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> But I don’t want you to.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t think you know what you do
want.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, I’m going in.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> We’ve got a lot to talk about.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She (uncertainly):</span> I oughtn’t.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What’s wrong with it? Don’t be dumb.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Goodnight. I guess we better say goodbye
too.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Not yet. Oh, have a little sense, will
you? He don’t know any more about you than
you know about him.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Stop talking like that.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, how about it?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Well——</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>The selection of music to be used for seduction
is not an arbitrary matter. A different
combination is necessary for every variation
in temperament. Some day it is to be hoped
that the difficulty will be overcome; perhaps
someone will be able to compile a
catalogue of effective combinations. Until
then the student can do no better than his
unassisted best.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>MUSIC GETS ME</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you think,” she says, “we’d have
something from last year, anyway? There isn’t
anything as dead as an old dance record. We used
to have parties and break the old ones, I remember.
And I made up my mind not to buy any more
except Red Seals, because the other ones were out
of date in a week. I believe that for a while I
spent my whole allowance on records, every
month.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s funny how fast they change,” you say,
balancing a particularly warped disk on your forefinger.
“Remember when jazz first came in—all
horns and those sweet-potato things? They
were awfully loud. Dad said the world was
going crazy. And then the toddle.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” she cries, standing on one foot and
bobbing up and down. “It was hard to break the
habit when it went out. What are you going to
play?”</p>

<p>You wind up the handle, and it squeaks in protest.
“Never mind. See if you recognize it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Venetian Moon! That reminds me of
something. Do songs mean things to you? Do
certain tunes bring back certain thoughts and feelings
to you?”</p>

<p>“Sure, whenever I hear Poor Butterfly I think
of Lorna Doone. I can’t trace the connection exactly,
but I always do.”</p>

<p>“It must have been played somewhere when
you read it,” she says. The record is finished,
and the needle scrapes with a harsh sound. “It’s
all rusty,” she adds. “I’m going to have it fixed
up. I’m tired of the radio anyway. I’d rather
choose what I want to hear.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Tea for Two. That was a pretty
good one.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she sighs. “I was kissed for the first
time when that was being played. What a fearfully
old record!”</p>

<p>Wind up the machine again and put it on, then
hold out your arms. “Let’s dance.”</p>

<p>She glides to you. After the first few bars
kiss her lightly. She stops, pushing you away.
“What’s the idea?” she demands.</p>

<p>“I was just trying to revive old memories,”
you explain. “Come on and finish; I’ll be good.
Say, you’re a peach of a dancer.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she says, going back to the Victrola.
“Whose old memories were you reviving then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be funny,” you grumble. “Here’s
a real old-timer.” Hold it up for her to read;
it is the Merry Widow Waltz.</p>

<p>“Mother used to dance to that,” she says.
“Let’s try to dance in the way they did in the play
last year.” But you can not imitate the graceful
swooping circles of the Viennese. “It’s not so
good,” she decides. “What else is here?”</p>

<p>“Here’s something called the Livery Stable
Blues. Do you know it? I don’t.” You put it
on, and a dreadful yowling fills the air. She
covers her ears.</p>

<p>“Stop it!” she cries. “Take it off! Imagine
dancing to that.”</p>

<p>“Oh gosh! Here’s Peggy O’Neill! That has
plenty of memories for me, all right. She turned
me down the same evening.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry, but you were too young to be
getting married anyway. Look at this? I wonder
why no one ever broke it. I think they played
it at my first Prom. It’s queer, but the only people
I remember at parties are perfectly irrelevant
ones; people I just have one dance with, or
something. This is having a very bad effect on me. I
feel so old and regretful.” She sighs and looks
in the mirror hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>“Well then,” say, winding up the machine
again, “Listen to this and have a real good cry.
You weren’t born yet when they were playing it.”
Start to sing with the music. “Oh, tell me,
pretty maiden, are there any more at home like
you? There are a few—kind sir——”</p>

<p>“I never even heard it,” she says. “It’s quite
catchy, too. They had a lot of good songs, in
their way. What are you doing? You’ll get all
dusty.”</p>

<p>You are struggling with a large pile of Red
Seals. “Sometimes they have a waltz or something
that you can use in these highbrow things,”
shuffling them. “Here’s something; Valse Bluette.
It might be good; let’s try to dance to it.”</p>

<p>But the rhythm is too varied for you. You
struggle for a while, and then she breaks away,
laughing and breathless.</p>

<p>“No good,” she says. “But here’s one of my
favorites. Do you mind? Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>John McCormick’s voice rings out richly,
marred only by a periodic scratch.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>“Isn’t that lovely?” she says, raptly. “I always
loved that song. Music always GETS me somehow.
Let’s play it again.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” you say. “I have something
else.” The sweet strains of Liebestraum make
the air sticky, and her ready laughter is stilled in
reverence.</p>

<p>Say, “I don’t know if you’ll like this one or not.
It’s a long one.”</p>

<p>She sits down on the divan. “Sure. Go ahead.
What is it? I don’t remember any of them.”</p>

<p>“L’Apres-Midi D’Un Faun.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“L’Apres-Midi D’Un Faun. It’s French.
Listen!”</p>

<p>She shakes her head briskly as you turn the
record over, and starts to talk. Motion to her to
be quiet, and play the second part. She speaks
drowsily.</p>

<p>“It’s very queer. It’s made me sleepy. Are you
playing it again? For heaven’s sake, why?”</p>

<p>“Well,” you explain, “it always sounds better
the second time.”</p>

<p>Listen to it again, with your hands clasped together.
Lean over to her. “It’s a funny thing
about that music. It gets me.” Kiss her.</p>

<p>“I know,” she says. “If I listened to it very
long I wouldn’t be responsible.”</p>

<p>“Responsible for what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just responsible.” Kiss her again. She
stands up. “Let’s play something loud and get
waked up.”</p>

<p>“This ought to be loud. The Fire Song.”</p>

<p>“No,” she decides, after a few bars, “it isn’t
loud enough. I can’t wake up. Play the Hymn
to the Sun.”</p>

<p>“It scratches,” you object. “Here’s one something
like it.”</p>

<p>Play the Song of India. She sighs and relaxes.</p>

<p>“I love that,” she says, dreamily. “What’s
that you’re going to play?”</p>

<p>Without answering her, put on L’Apres-Midi
D’Un Faun.</p>

<p>The young man in our illustration has compunctions
about taking advantage of sentiments
so like his own, but sheer inertia
carries him along. So it will probably be
in your case.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>EVERYBODY DOES</p>

<p>“I think you’re perfectly TERRIBLE,” says
the girl, smiling as if she doesn’t expect to be
believed. “Whoever told you all about everything?
I wouldn’t want to live if I felt that way.
Why, what would we be here for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we have to be here for anything,
particularly,” you answer. “What are
mosquitoes for?”</p>

<p>She hesitates for only a second.</p>

<p>“So we won’t get too lazy. They probably
wonder why we’re here, slapping them just when
they want to eat.”</p>

<p>Look through the window to the lawn outside,
covered with snow.</p>

<p>“That’s an unusual remark for a girl of your
sort to make,” you muse. “Well, you probably
talk that way because this is winter. Now, if I
had asked you in July, when there would be plenty
of mosquitoes——”</p>

<p>“What ARE you talking about?” she asks.
“What do you mean, a girl of my type?”</p>

<p>Laugh and glance at her obliquely. She is very
pretty, you think, with that maddeningly serene
face of hers. Just now, though she is interested,
her expression isn’t really with you. You want to
do something about it.</p>

<p>“I mean a girl of your type,” repeat firmly.
“A girl who believes everything she’s taught.”</p>

<p>She frowns a little.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be silly to go to school for as
long as I have if I didn’t use what they told me?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t what school is for,” you answer
hastily. Lord, what a dumbbell! Why am I
here, anyway? But she <span class='it'>is</span> pretty.</p>

<p>“You’re pretty, anyway,” you say aloud.</p>

<p>“But that’s awfully mean! Pretty anyway!
What do you mean? Don’t you think a girl can
be pretty and have brains too?”</p>

<p>“Well—brains of a sort.” Now what am I in
for? “Sure I guess you have brains. I bet you’re
practical in business things.”</p>

<p>“Heavens, no!” she protests. “I can’t do a
thing. But I was good at school. I was terribly
good in Latin.”</p>

<p>Turn a little on the sofa and smile at her, leaning
back. “Ever have any philosophy courses?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she says promptly. “Three hours
a week.”</p>

<p>“And Chapel every morning?”</p>

<p>“Every morning.”</p>

<p>“What did you do in Philosophy? I know
about the Chapel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we studied what all those old birds
thought about the world and the mind and reality
and those things. And at examinations they
asked us to summarize the different points of
view.”</p>

<p>“And you had Chapel every day?” you persist.
This is something.</p>

<p>“I told you. It was compulsory.”</p>

<p>“They told you what to think, in Chapel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” she cries. “No. Sometimes the
Doctor would talk about smoking for girls, and
sometimes about movies. And there is a beautiful
sermon that he always gives at Easter, about
bread and hyacinths. That’s about Art, you
know.”</p>

<p>Nod thoughtfully. “Yes. He likes Art,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“You’re teasing me,” she says, sadly. “Whenever
I talk about religion you get that way. I
don’t see why we’re always fighting.”</p>

<p>“We’re not always fighting, are we? All right,
let’s stop talking about school. But I did want
to ask you something. Why do you think it’s so
shocking when I say that God isn’t watching
everything you do?” And you think with some
anger at yourself that here you are again.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was shocking,” she says
eagerly. “I’m never shocked. I was just surprised
when you told Lilian you didn’t think He
was personal enough to have opinions on Prohibition.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think He is?” you ask. Put
your arm around her shoulders; she snuggles
down comfortably.</p>

<p>“Well,” she begins reasonably, “how would
we all be here? Don’t you think we must have
come from—I mean, don’t you see that we <span class='it'>must</span>
be something like Him? Not so perfect or so big
and powerful, but—why everybody knows that!”</p>

<p>“So that makes it all right,” you tease her. “If
everybody thinks so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they’ve always thought so, for
years. And it seems to work. Here we are,
aren’t we? Don’t you think we’re improving? It
must be right.”</p>

<p>“How did we get started on all this, anyway?”
You are bored. “It was talking about Prohibition.
It always happens.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s how it happened. You fired up
when Lilian said it was a success. I’m glad
Mother wasn’t there to hear you. She’s a little
afraid of you anyway.”</p>

<p>“Is she? Why? I’m safe enough. We just
talk—and talk—and talk!” Confound old
women!</p>

<p>“I know,” she says happily. “I love to talk
seriously. We used to have lots of arguments
in my room at school, after hours.... No, I
think you’re right; I don’t think Prohibition’s a
success at all. I think anybody with sense would
know it. Look at the way perfectly nice boys
get drunk at every party. I almost died the first
time my escort did. Dad said he’d shoot the
young puppy. Mother says that <span class='it'>never</span> used to
happen. I think Prohibition is terrible.”</p>

<p>“You are pretty,” say irrelevantly, and kiss her.
She returns the kiss placidly.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t,” she says, lazily.</p>

<p>“Why? Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What made you think I did?”</p>

<p>“Well, most girls do. In fact, I might say that
everybody does.”</p>

<p>“Not girls!” she protests, shocked.</p>

<p>“For Pete’s sake!” you cry, exasperated.
“Who on earth told you that? You don’t really
think so, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Don’t you take a lot for granted?”</p>

<p>“I never take anything for granted. Why do
you wear blue? Because it’s becoming. Well,
why do you want to look pretty? So that I’ll kiss
you. Of course!”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that. I don’t want you to.”</p>

<p>“If I thought you meant it I’d stop. Look
here——” Oh Lord, can’t I quit it? “Listen.
You’re not consistent.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“You say that whatever people do must be all
right, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“If everybody does it and it works out.”</p>

<p>“Well, doesn’t everybody do this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an idiot! How do you suppose you
were born?”</p>

<p>“But my parents were married.”</p>

<p>You tear your hair. How can one be reasonable
with such stupidity?</p>

<p>“That hasn’t any physiological significance!”</p>

<p>“I don’t——”</p>

<p>“You COULD have been born without their
being married, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>She considers, then smiles triumphantly. “Not
with my parents!”</p>

<p>“But what the hell did you and your friends
talk about at school?”</p>

<p>“Well, some of the girls might have been fast.
They wouldn’t say, of course.”</p>

<p>“A lot more than you suspected were probably
‘fast.’”</p>

<p>She resents this. “I’m not so dumb as you
think.”</p>

<p>You feel guilty, and at the same time stubborn.
You know this feeling: you have had it before and
it always gets you into trouble.</p>

<p>“All right. Suppose I talked a little about
your friend Lilian? How long have you known
her?”</p>

<p>“All my life. Why——” in quick alarm—“do
you mean to say that you know anything about
Lilian that I don’t?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk about Lilian. But you’re
very trusting for your age. Everyone lies to
everybody; didn’t you know that? Kiss me and
forget about it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. You have to tell me. Tell me!”</p>

<p>For a moment you feel sorry. You shouldn’t
have done it; you know it. Your arm tightens
about her. You have to stop her somehow; she
is going to cry.</p>

<p>“Please don’t worry so. Everybody does.
Please don’t cry, baby. You are a baby. It
really doesn’t matter, I tell you. Not if everybody
does.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“All right! I didn’t mean it!”</p>

<p>She wipes her eyes and sits up, looking at you
curiously.</p>

<p>“Really? Did you mean it? Everybody?
Lilian? You?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk.” You feel miserable.
You feel like worrying her some more. Put your
arms around her, give her a little shake.</p>

<p>“Stop talking about it!” Kiss her hard; she
kisses you with a new quality in her response.
There is something defiant in her kiss.</p>

<p>Later, going home, you begin to feel badly
again.</p>

<p>“I wish I could control myself. I always get
into trouble. That was queer, though. Oh, well.”</p>

<p>Pause at the edge of the pavement, watching
the sweep of the traffic, “She <span class='it'>is</span> pretty.”</p>

<p>The directness of this method calls for a

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>THIS BUSINESS</p>

<p>It is peaceful everywhere in town, but the barber
shop is the most peaceful place of all. Two
of the boys are working; talking in low tones to
their customers; and the third is drowsing in the
corner, behind the two-foot square bootblacking
establishment. He has long since read all the
ancient Libertys and Colliers and newspapers
that are lying on the chairs. The air is full of
gentle boredom.</p>

<p>Then through the door comes a stranger. She
looks about the shop hesitantly; the two men that
are sprawled out having haircuts glance at her
apathetically through the mirror. Not you, however.
You leap to position behind your chair
and wave your towel encouragingly, almost lovingly.
You feel actually affectionate; it has been
a very dull afternoon. She isn’t bad either; clean
and pink-looking.</p>

<p>“Yes ma’am,” you murmur, as you tuck the
fragrant towel into the collar of her dress.
“Shingle?”</p>

<p>“Not too short, please,” she answers. “Just
a trim.”</p>

<p>Set to work with a flourish. The barber on the
end winks at you, but pretend not to see it. All
is quiet for a few minutes except for the snipping
of the scissors, and then the coon who belongs to
the bootblacking establishment shuffles through
the door and puts a record on the Victrola in the
corner.</p>

<p>Hum the tune and step lively as you reach for
the clippers. Catch the customer’s eye in the mirror
and smile. She responds slightly.</p>

<p>“It may be old,” say jovially, “but it’s still
good.”</p>

<p>“I always did like it,” she admits.</p>

<p>Bend over and snip critically at a tuft of hair
just behind her ear.</p>

<p>“What I say is,” murmur confidingly, “I’d
rather have a good old tune if it’s really good
than a lot of new junk. It’s funny about songs.
I play the clarinet myself. Sometimes you’ll have
a lot of swell ones and then a year’ll go by and
you won’t have anything worth playing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” says the lady.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you in here about a month back?”
Pause with upraised scissors to regard your work
in the mirror.</p>

<p>“No,” she says, “I’m new in town. I was
through here once when I was a baby, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny. I thought sure I cut your hair
once before.”</p>

<p>“No, you couldn’t have.”</p>

<p>“Who did cut it last time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. A fellow in Dodge City.”</p>

<p>“It looks like a Dodge City haircut. They
must learn how to cut hair by correspondence in
that town.” Chuckle at the joke. She is annoyed.</p>

<p>“It looked all right to me,” she says promptly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answer her, “it looks all right. I’m
not saying it didn’t look all right. It’s when it
gets long the unevenness shows up, but you don’t
need to worry. It looks all right now.”</p>

<p>Work industriously for a minute, then step
back again to survey the effect. “Do you want it
any shorter on the side there?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you think looks best. I guess you
know more about how it ought to look.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” you protest.</p>

<p>“Sure you do,” she says.</p>

<p>“You going to stay in town long?” Select a
pair of clippers.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here for good, I guess. I’ve got a
job here.”</p>

<p>“That’s swell,” heartily. “We need new people
here. Don’t we, Jim?”</p>

<p>The second barber jumps and looks up. “Eh?”
he says.</p>

<p>“I was just telling the little lady we need new
people here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, uh, yes. Sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” you resume, “it’s a good town, but
sometimes you get to wishing there were more
people. You know, young people.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must say it doesn’t look very lively to
me,” she says. “Of course I’m used to Dodge
City; that’s pretty lively.”</p>

<p>“Well now, I don’t know. You have to make
your own excitement, of course. But it ain’t so
bad. If you get in with the right kind, of course.
A place like this, it’s pretty important what kind
you get in with.”</p>

<p>One by one, the other customers leave and their
barbers drift outside to loaf in the sun. Tiny
grains of powder dance in the beams that slant to
the floor of the shop.</p>

<p>“Do you mind the clippers?”</p>

<p>“No, go ahead.”</p>

<p>Work a minute in silence.</p>

<p>“Say,” you begin, “would you mind my asking
you a personal question?”</p>

<p>“It depends on what it is.” She lowers her
eyes to her lap.</p>

<p>“Are you married?”</p>

<p>She smiles. “You’ve got a nerve. No, I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.”</p>

<p>“Why? It’s none of your business, is it?”</p>

<p>“You don’t act very friendly, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe in acting as friendly as
some people do.”</p>

<p>Laugh heartily and start to comb her hair
tightly over her forehead.</p>

<p>“You know, you got pretty hair,” you say. She
glances at it rather complacently in the mirror,
and tips her head. Resume impulsively, “You
know, this business is awfully hard on a man of
my calibre.”</p>

<p>She is unsympathetic. “What do you want me
to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I was just wondering if you were
busy tonight.”</p>

<p>She giggles. “Who wants to know?”</p>

<p>“Ah, cut that out!” you cry, flicking the big
duster on her neck. “I want to know. Who did
you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about tonight,” she muses.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a flivver. There ought to be a dance
somewhere. I bet you’re a mighty good little
dancer.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” she admits, “but I don’t think I’d
better.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m just starting out in this place. You
know how it is.”</p>

<p>“What’s the harm? A ride and a little drink
won’t hurt you. If you like I’ll ask a couple of
friends. Listen....”</p>

<p>One of the other barbers comes in again, and
you stop abruptly. The haircut is obviously finished.
Untuck the towel with lingering fingers
and step to the door with her as she fumbles in
her purse.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents, ma’am,” you say loudly, and add
in a low voice, “Listen. Eight o’clock, see? What
address?”</p>

<p>“Four eighty-three Garden. But I don’t
know....”</p>

<p>“Oh, who’ll ever know about it? Eight o’clock,
O.K. Fifty cents, seventy-five, one dollar. Thank
you ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Say Jim, did you see that!”</p>

<p>She watches you lazily while you souse the
dishes in the lake and wipe them clumsily. She
feels rather guilty about it, but at the beginning of
the hike you have insisted on taking care of everything.
It is your party. And it is a nice party,
too. The moon is there, and the air is warm, and
somewhere there is a flower that smells very
sweet. She closes her eyes and leans against the
rock and feels happy.</p>

<p>Knock the ashes out of your pipe and sit down
by her, taking her hand in yours. “Swell night,”
you say.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I’m having a good time.”</p>

<p>“So am I. I’ve had a better time today than
I can remember since I don’t know when.”</p>

<p>“Really?” she protests smiling. “How about
that race at Mackinac?”</p>

<p>“That was pretty good too. Only you weren’t
along. It could have been perfect.”</p>

<p>She laughs easily. “I’d have been in the way.
You’ve never tried telling me anything else before.
What’s the matter with you tonight? Getting
soft?”</p>

<p>“Not much use of that, is there?” You both
chuckle. “You’re too cagey. I couldn’t say anything
nice to you even if I meant it. You’d bite
my head off.”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>Push her in mock exasperation, then take her
hand again. She is a little uneasy about it, and
leans over to tie her boot-lace more securely.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right with me,” say suddenly.
“You know, you’re a pretty game kid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“You sure are. Lots of people must have told
you so before. I like you. Do you know it?”</p>

<p>“Glad you do,” she says. “I like you.”</p>

<p>“There, that’s just what I mean.” Fill your
pipe again. “Saying it out, frankly, like that.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I, if it’s true?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t really know why you shouldn’t.
But most girls wouldn’t. You know how women
are.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” she says, largely.</p>

<p>“Gee,” you cry. “The way you say that!
Funny kid.”</p>

<p>“Now, what sounded funny about that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. It sounded so boyish.
You’re just like a boy, now that I think of it.”
Turn and smile at her.</p>

<p>“Thanks! I always wanted to be a boy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you did. Gosh, though, I wouldn’t if
I were you.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Girls have a much better time. I wouldn’t
mind if someone had to buy my tickets and take
me out to dinner once in a while.”</p>

<p>She thinks about it for a minute, poking the fire
with the toe of her heavy boot. “I’m not sure,”
she says slowly. “We pay for it, in a way. Suppose
you had to see as much of some of the idiots
that we do? You can just ask anyone you want;
we have to wait till we’re asked.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so. Some of them are pretty bad,
I guess.” You laugh. “Anyway, I always thought
some of your friends were, but I never dared to
say so. What’s the matter with ’em, exactly?”</p>

<p>“They’re so stupid!” she cries. “They think
all a girl is good for is to paw. They haven’t any
idea of real fun at all.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Pat her arm comfortingly. “Just
grab you as soon they look at you, don’t they?
Most men are like that, I guess. I don’t understand
it myself. I’m no saint, but I couldn’t have
anything to do with a girl unless I liked her.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she says, flushing a little in excitement.
“I feel that way exactly. I’m so glad you
do too. I was beginning to think that men were
just different. Most of them——”</p>

<p>“Sure. Honestly, do they bother you so much?”
You frown.</p>

<p>“Yes, even me. Can you imagine? Me!”</p>

<p>“That just shows you. If you’ll pardon my
being frank....”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine anything like that, with you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I know. That’s why we get along
so well, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We are—friends, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>Squeeze her hand and puff at your pipe, thinking
deeply. Then sigh, and say, “Funny thing, sex.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it!”</p>

<p>“You know, it’s wonderful to be able to talk
like this to a girl. I couldn’t if you were really
a—a woman in my mind. But I don’t feel that
way about you at all. You’re my friend. You
don’t appeal to me that way.”</p>

<p>She wonders vaguely if she likes that. But she
answers quickly. “Thank you. I know you mean
it. You know, a friendship like that is valuable
to me, too. I need it. I used to think that no
matter how much I tried, it was just impossible to
have a man for a real friend.”</p>

<p>“Really? Then we’re square, because you
mean a lot to me.”</p>

<p>Put your arm around her and look into the fire.</p>

<p>“That’s another thing,” she says, thoughtfully.
“That’s another reason I wish I could be
a man. You have an awfully easy time with that
sort of thing, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“What? Gosh, no. I don’t see how anybody
could think so.”</p>

<p>“Really? I always thought you did. I don’t
know very much about it, but——”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you don’t!” you growl with such
fervor that she is surprised.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? You shouldn’t care
anything about what I do—like that. Not if we’re
friends the way you say.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you.” Pull her closer to your
shoulder. “I can’t break away from a funny idea
I have about you. I want you to stay just as
straight as you are. It’s a queer thing, sex. I
don’t want you spoiled. That fine straightness of
yours is so rare. I guess I’m selfish to want anyone
to live up to my ideals, but I do want you to
keep it.” Give her a little hug.</p>

<p>She answers gravely. “Yes, I know. I want
to stay the way I am, too. I don’t know how I
really feel about it, I guess, but I do—I mean, I
like myself now, do you see? It’s awfully hard
to express.”</p>

<p>“I know. Gee, you’re a peach, kid. I do like
you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks....” Kiss her softly on the cheek.
“Look!” she cries, sitting up a little straighter.
“There’s a shooting star.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully nice. Come back here. Afraid of
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” But she sits up.</p>

<p>“You don’t trust me?”</p>

<p>“Don’t! Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Then why act like that? You’ll hurt my feelings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to!” She settles back
against your shoulder. Kiss her on the mouth;
she struggles away.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, dear?” you murmur. “I
thought you trusted me. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t mean—I do trust you.
Only....” She stops and looks away from you.</p>

<p>“Then what is it? I don’t understand. Do
you mean you—you can’t trust yourself? I
thought you were so sensible about these things.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can. I’m not a man!”</p>

<p>“No, dear. But you’re a woman, aren’t you?
Are you afraid, really?”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid. I just didn’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry....”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean I didn’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Just don’t care?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly that....”</p>

<p>Laugh. “You’re a darling. I’m going to kiss
you again. That’ll be all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I guess so.”</p>

<p>“You really liked it.”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Don’t keep moving away like that! I’ll think
you hate me. You just said we were friends.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but....”</p>

<p>“Comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but....”</p>

<p>“There now, I won’t bother you any more if

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>Somehow the sight of a man being paternal
arouses in woman a protective instinct on
her own part; an indulgent affection compounded
of amusement and gratitude.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>PROMISE ME YOU WON’T</p>

<p>You are uncomfortable. You are both sitting
on one of the sofas, but with a great difference of
mien. She is curled up among the cushions—she
is a supple little thing, and seems to be comfortable,
but you are leaning forward with your
hands clasped between your knees, which are
rather ludicrously raised from the floor because
the couch sags. Anyway, it is never becoming to
you to argue; your face grows red and you look
more clumsy than ever. She is enjoying the new
sensation of seeing you ill at ease, and because of
her. In the office it is so often the other way
around.</p>

<p>“But I don’t think it is good for you,” you are
saying.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t good for anyone to be too much
alone.” Speak doggedly in the tone of one who
has made the same remark at intervals all his
life.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” she protests. “I think it depends a
lot on the person. I think everybody ought to
have privacy. I don’t see how the people here
do without it, I really don’t. I have to keep my
shades down all the time, living in the basement
like this. Even at that the girls are always coming
in—a couple of people have keys.”</p>

<p>“What?” you cry. She laughs.</p>

<p>“Just the girls, silly.” You are somewhat confused
and she feels abashed at having called you
silly. It sounds too intimate, somehow. Move
your feet uneasily and knit your brows in an effort
to say tactfully just what you think.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it. You need your rest. It’s all
right for a while but pretty soon it’ll react on
you. I don’t understand you girls. You don’t
use one of these studios for anything, you’re
at the office all day anyway. You don’t even save
so much money.” She laughs and then looks at
you inquisitively.</p>

<p>“Really, you’re taking it awfully hard. What’s
the matter? What’s worrying you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.... I just don’t like it all.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she says, teasingly. “You didn’t
like the dinner. I know you didn’t. Confess you
didn’t!”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about the dinner,” you say
hastily. “I don’t care much about what I eat; it
was only that the place didn’t look clean. You
never eat their stew or anything like that, do
you?”</p>

<p>She answers sarcastically, “It’s terribly nice of
you to worry so much about me....” and you
flush.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t talk like that. Please don’t.”</p>

<p>“No, honestly, I mean it. I wrote Mother that
she certainly wouldn’t worry so much about me if
she could hear how you’re always lecturing me.
I’m so afraid you’ll walk into the office some day
when it’s raining and bellow, ‘Miss Merrill,
where are your rubbers?’”</p>

<p>This is better. Relax and laugh loudly. “Better
look out, or I will!”</p>

<p>In the relaxed atmosphere of the joke you suddenly
find enough courage to lean over the necessary
few inches and put a hand on her shoulder,
rubbing your cheek against hers for a second.</p>

<p>She is discomposed, although it is not very surprising
after all.</p>

<p>“Here!” she protests, breathlessly. “Stop
that! Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Sorry. But I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Well....” She is at a loss. She giggles and
says, “And besides, you need a shave.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Sorry.... Another thing, I think
probably you don’t have very good people hanging
around here.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell? You haven’t met anyone
but Mary. You said she has nice ankles.”</p>

<p>“Did I?” you ask, surprised. “Maybe I did.
But I don’t like women to cut their hair so short.
That’s one of the things I like about you, by the
way. You may be in business and all that, but
you haven’t lost your femininity.” Close your hand
over hers where it lies on the cushion.</p>

<p>“That’s not a compliment these days.”</p>

<p>Shake your head violently. “Don’t kid yourself.
We really like the same type all the time,
we men. You know, you worry me a lot in the
office.”</p>

<p>“Really? How?”</p>

<p>“Well, because——” Stop and knit your
brows. You are trying very hard to express yourself
sincerely. “In the office you treat everybody so
darned nice.... I mean you’re a great little
mixer and it’s fine for business, but doesn’t anyone
ever misunderstand? You know what I mean,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>She looks at you with a startled expression
which changes to a hurt one. She falters. “You
mean I don’t act—do I act too fast? I’m awfully
sorry. I thought that——”</p>

<p>Pat her hand furiously. “No, no! You act
fine! I didn’t mean to criticize you at all, but you
know how men are. Listen here.” You raise
her chin and look at her eyes searchingly. “If
anybody tries to put anything over on you I want
you to come and tell me about it. I want to be
a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she says softly, “I consider you
a friend now.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty nice of you. It makes me feel
fine. You’re such a decent kid, and I don’t think
you know a thing about life.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cries pettishly, “there you go again!
I guess I can take care of myself!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this is what worries me. I don’t like
the idea of these long-haired kids filling your
mind up with free love theories and all that.
You’re an intelligent kid too, and youngsters like
you are sort of experimental.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. You don’t know; you can’t
tell now how you might feel one of these days.
It’s dangerous, this stuff. You may not know it,
but we’re a pretty rotten lot. Most men are out
for what they can get.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s horrid; to be worrying like that
all the time. I don’t want to have to be on my
guard all the time.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. Of course you don’t.”</p>

<p>“And as for my being silly, I think you ought
to realize that I have a little common sense. Or
even if you don’t think so, don’t you think that I
have some ideals?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I like to hear you talk. Maybe
you think I’m being sort of nosey, but I can’t help
worrying about you. You’re awfully sweet.”</p>

<p>She has a fleeting moment of misgiving. This
isn’t the way a boss ought to be talking. But you
are very kind to be so worried.... “Yes,” she
says, flippantly, “If I were Miss Moser you
wouldn’t take so much trouble, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, nobody’s likely to bother her, at her
age. I do want to keep an eye on you. You don’t
look so efficient as you are; a man’s likely to
forget what a swell little secretary you are when he
looks at you. Here, isn’t this more comfortable?”
Put your arm under her head. The room
is very still and cozy. “Listen.”</p>

<p>“What?” she says, comfortably.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I want to ask you to promise me something.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Promise me that—that you won’t let anyone....”
Silence. “Hm-m-m?”</p>

<p>“If you think that I need to promise——”</p>

<p>Kiss her (to silence her). Then—“You know
I don’t mistrust you,” you say, gruffly, “but I get
worried. Won’t you promise?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” she answers. The silence of the room
flows over you again, and it too holds a promise.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think,” says Cynthia, “that as a

trying to <span class='it'>cultivate</span> a soul.”</p>

<p>“No,” you answer lazily, wisely, “I should

No, the true sense of beauty thrives only where it

<p>She says nothing; she does not even sigh. She
looks at you and waits.</p>

<p>“Ah, youth, youth! The beautiful simplicity,
the terrible complexity of inexperience. Straight,
clean.... I have lost the gift. I cannot read that
poetry. Give me the sophisticated; the keen irony
of Eliot; the ponderous exaltation of the negroes....”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she says, in a rather chastened
tone. “But I still like music in my poetry. Don’t
you still like the Hymn to Proserpine—or don’t
you remember? ‘From too much love of living——’”</p>

<p>Take it up and finish it smoothly, with an indulgent
smile but giving it full value and a dying fall.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager,” you say, smiling, “that you know
every word of Rupert Brooke.”</p>

<p>She blushes. “That isn’t fair! You know
all about me!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t hard,” you say. “I was so much like
you at your age, you see. There, I’ll stop teasing.
Let’s talk about something else. Look at my
greatest treasure, down there in the corner of the
bookshelf. No, not that. That’s a Blake. It’s
a nice little thing, but you’ll get yourself dusty.
There it is. First edition. Did you ever see one
before?”</p>

<p>She is not sure which of the two volumes you
are speaking of; the Beardsley Salome or the new
Contes Drolatique. She is exquisitely careful and
reverent with both of them; opening one on her
lap and looking at it for a minute. She doesn’t
stay interested very long, however. She wants
to listen.</p>

<p>“Just toys, of course,” you say. “I’m ridiculously
dependent on material things like that.
The more delicate the edifice the more firm the
foundation, I’ve decided. No——” as she starts
to speak, with an ardent gasp—“I know you don’t
agree with me. The tree of Job and a savorless
crust in the desert for you; with a voluptuous
purple sunset in piquant contrast....”</p>

<p>“That’s cruel of you!” she cries.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. You mustn’t be so sensitive. I
like to tease you; then I’m always sorry. I don’t
know why I do it. Yes I do. It’s really that I
envy—bitterly—your ideal asceticism. So you
mustn’t pay any attention to me. I’m pink and
old and plump and I don’t know what I’m talking
about. Go on home and call up your—Boy
Friend, isn’t that what you call him? Go on out
and dance, little pagan. Dance and stop worrying.
I’ll worry for you. I’ll burn incense and
think of you, and pray for myself.”</p>

<p>She ignores this nobly. “Incense? Where do
you burn it? In front of that gold thing there?”</p>

<p>“Thing? My dear!” Speak gravely. “Tread
softly: he hates you enough already. He is old
and you are young: he is only half divine, and
you....”</p>

<p>“I do believe,” she giggles, “that you’re really
afraid of him!”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. But I shall overthrow him
soon, out of my own strength. I’m going to be
a Papist.”</p>

<p>“Honestly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has the true aestheticism of aristocracy.”</p>

<p>She sighs. “You say things so wonderfully.
You’re absolutely continental.”</p>

<p>“Dear child! You shall have some tea for
that. My very special flower tea. Sit there so
I can see you while I fix it. No, don’t read that
book. It isn’t for little girls.”</p>

<p>She promptly begins to read it. Bring out the
table and connect the little electric range for hot
water. The long shadowy room grows darker
and outside the automobiles begin to turn on their
lights.</p>

<p>“There now,” you say. “Take this, if you
like the cup.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it lovely! I think it’s so nice that
your cups are all different. Mother simply insists
on having everything in sets, even our
books.”</p>

<p>Groan in agony, and you smile at each other,
feeling cozy and superior. She eats one piece of
cinnamon toast and glances wistfully at another,
but decides against it.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave the things for Maria in the
morning,” you explain. “Then it’s perfect. Now
where is that poem you were going to show me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t,” she cries. “It’s dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, please,” you beg.</p>

<p>“All right. I think you’d better read it yourself.
Don’t you hate to have people read your
things?” Miserably, she pretends to look at a
book while you read.</p>

<p>“But this is lovely!” you cry. “Here, I’ll read
it aloud.</p>

<p>Lovely! It has a freshness, a sincerity....”</p>

<p>“Oh, honestly? You’re just saying it!”</p>

<p>You answer severely, “I’m not speaking now
as a friend, my dear. I’m speaking as a critic.”</p>

<p>“Then could you tell me how to improve it?”
she begs. “It needs—something.” You both
think deeply.</p>

<p>“M-m-m,” say in a judicial tone. “Let’s see. One
thing I’d do, perhaps—but no. Perhaps I’d transpose
the words in the penultimate line and then it
would read ‘sleep and dream’ instead of ‘dream
and sleep.’ Otherwise the thing is perfect.”</p>

<p>She nods vigorously. “Yes, you’re very right.
I see it now. Thank you so much. It’s wonderful
of you to bother.”</p>

<p>“Bother? It’s no bother. You don’t realize—you
can’t realize what your youth does for me. Almost,
my dear, almost I forget my figure and my horrible
hair and—well, never mind. It doesn’t matter.
What does anything matter in the clearness
of your voice and the gladness of your face?”</p>

<p>She sits very still as you pass your hand gently
over her hair. Her shining eyes are fixed on
something invisible that hovers in the room just
over your head. Mystery, or the answer to all
mystery? A new confidence, a new belief, are
coming into her life. It is like being kissed in a
dream; wondering a little, but detached; peaceful
in an even exaltation.</p>

<hr class='dtb'/>

<p>The room grows darker and the swish of the
motors make a faint pulsing music from the boulevard.
There comes an evening coolness. She is
thinking; her cheeks are flushed. The bright
colors of the books on the shelf are smothered
in darkness, but you can see that her cheeks are
flushed. She has forgotten where she is, who she
is, everything. Very softly, taking elaborate care
to avoid the tea-table, go over to the door and
lock it.</p>

<p>“I love this,” she says.</p>

<p>“So do I,” you answer. “I’m sorry the place is
so messy. I didn’t notice until you walked in.
That nigger never cleans up unless Emma keeps
after her. I don’t know what’ll happen now.”</p>

<p>“Well, when Emma gets back it’ll be all right,”

<p>Glance at her in some surprise. “But I thought

she didn’t tell you? I thought you were the
first one she told. I’m so sorry. I’d better——”</p>

<p>“You’d better tell me about it,” says Barbara.
“She didn’t really have a chance, the last time I
saw her. My sister had lunch with us and went
down to the station too.”</p>

<p>“Sure, that explains it. Why, it was this way.
We went up to the cottage in June, and she went
to Bedford after that. We came to an agreement
after we left the city; I don’t know just when. It
took a long time. We changed our minds a lot.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” she murmurs.</p>

<p>“Well,” you go on, “it’s been three months
anyway, off and on. I guess we’ve just been really
separated for a couple of weeks. It seems longer
because of that adjustment period. She can do
what she likes about the divorce; I’ve left it up
to her. I told her to do what she thought best.
Emma knows how to go about business and all
that. Of course I’ll agree to anything.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’ve definitely decided——” Her
voice is incredulous.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s definite. But if you mean is it all
over, yes. We agree on that, absolutely. Are
you really so surprised?”</p>

<p>She thinks about it for a minute. “No,” she
decides, “not really. I noticed something. That
night you had the party before we all went to
the beach, I knew there was something wrong.
But I had no idea.... Do you mind talking
about it? Some people might.”</p>

<p>Shake your head and laugh. “Certainly not.
It hasn’t been particularly painful, you see.
You’re one of the family anyway. Why should
I mind?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you feel that way about it,” she says.
“Of course I’m frightfully interested.”</p>

<p>“Then it wouldn’t bore you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she says. She maintains a reserved attitude;
politely interested. Sit back against the
cushions and draw a deep breath.</p>

<p>“I want to be fair to Emma. I guess the fault
was on both sides. I can’t help remembering that
after all, it was my idea that we get married. I
remember it perfectly well: I had to argue with
her. You mustn’t think that I’m trying to whine
about it.” Smile at her rather sadly and whimsically.</p>

<p>“Ben, you know I don’t,” she cries.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Naturally I feel a little defensive.
After all, I suppose you’re on her side. I

<p>“Don’t be silly. I just want to hear the truth.
You’re both my friends.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I wanted you to say, Barbara.”
The fire crackles comfortably. “Well, anyway,
there it is. I don’t know just how it happened.
My fault, I suppose, but I refuse to feel guilty.
I’m awful. I keep wondering why in hell I wanted
to get married. I remember in a very vague and
impersonal sort of way that she was pretty.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she says eagerly. “<span class='it'>Wasn’t</span> she
pretty?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when all the trouble did start.
I can’t even figure it out. I don’t know that I
want to.” Kick the flaming log.</p>

<p>“I think I can understand,” she says slowly.
“Of course I’m trying to be impartial, and Emma’s
one of my best friends, but I think that I do understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you would understand,” you answer.
“There’s one thing, though, that I’d like to tell
you. I mean this: I do feel badly about it. I
may not act that way, but I do. It’s been awfully
hard on her. Don’t think I haven’t worried.”</p>

<p>“You know, Ben, there’s something I want to
say.” She sits up and folds her hands.</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t any right to say it, but I’m
going to. I think that your trouble is, you worry
too much.”</p>

<p>“Me? Worry? Barbara, you’re a nut!”</p>

<p>“I mean it. You think too much for her and
everybody else. You pretend to be absolutely
careless about everyone else, but you aren’t. You
can’t get along like that; it isn’t nature. It doesn’t
work out.”</p>

<p>“Maybe.” Frown at the fire. “Maybe. But
what about her? She can’t face things alone,
you know. I’m sorry if I’m talking too much,
but this is serious. Now we’re started on a long
subject. She simply can’t do it. She isn’t fitted
for it. You must know that. You’re an old friend
of hers.”</p>

<p>“Ben, how long have you been worrying like
this about other people?”</p>

<p>“You’re asking me how old I am!” you cry in
dismay. “It isn’t polite of you. I’m much too
old for you to be wasting your time on my domestic
troubles. You’ll have to be satisfied with that.
I won’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“I know how old you are. Emma told me
when you were married. What’s the matter with
you? You’re not old.”</p>

<p>Get up and fix the fire to hide your pleasure.</p>

<p>“You’re a sweet girl, Barbara. You’ve always
been the only one of Emma’s friends I had any use
for. You’re the only mutual friend we’ve ever
had, I may say.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Ben. Anyway I’m flattered that
you’ve told me so much.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why I did. There’s something about
you that makes people talk. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Is there?”</p>

<p>“I think it must be that you’re so honest, yourself.
How do you happen to be so honest?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Most people are.”</p>

<p>“No they aren’t. Most women aren’t. Emma
wasn’t. You knew that, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>She considers it. “Oh, Emma didn’t lie.”</p>

<p>“Not directly. But Emma was essentially
feminine; essentially evasive. You aren’t.”</p>

<p>“No,” she admits, serenely.</p>

<p>The silence is becoming dangerous.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” she cries, suddenly. “I had no
idea it was so late. I’ll have to go.”</p>

<p>“Wait until this log burns down,” you suggest.
“You surely aren’t in such a hurry as all that. I’m
afraid to be left alone. You’ve no idea how lonely
an old man can get in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>She laughs. “Well, I’ll wait for a little. I
hate to leave the fire. I’m getting old, too.”</p>

<p>“Besides, you’re a very busy person and I
haven’t really seen you all year. I think I’ve just
realized how nice an evening like this could be. I
think I’ve been waiting for this for days, without
knowing it. I feel much better, really.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” she says, seriously. “I’ve been
a little bit blue, myself.”</p>

<p>“You?” Incredulous. “I didn’t know that
you ever felt blue. What on earth were you blue
about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m such a useless person. I don’t really
do a damned thing. I’ve been thinking all day
about things. And then when I see people like
you and Emma having your troubles too—you
were two people that I always thought of as being
fulfilled, sort of. Now it seems to take away my
last hope. Emma’s my best friend, in a way, and
now I find that you’ve both been very unhappy.
It just fits in with everything else.”</p>

<p>“You make me feel very guilty. I didn’t want
to depress you. I’ve been selfish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was depressed already! No, you made
me feel a little better, somehow.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” you say softly, “I do think you’re
taking it harder than I did. You’ve been telling
me that I am too sympathetic, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t just sympathy, perhaps,” she
says. “I was applying everything to myself.”</p>

<p>“You think too much,” you advise. “Stop
thinking too hard about life. It never does any
good. I know. I’ve done it too.”</p>

<p>She is silent, and you begin again. “Barbara,”
taking her hand, “I want to give you some advice.
I’m a lot older than you are and I think we’re
something alike. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” she says. “I have thought so.”</p>

<p>“There are things a lot more important than
little married relationships such as Emma’s and
mine. It’s those things that really fill our lives,
Barbara. For instance this talk I’ve had with
you tonight means much more to me than any
little love-affair. Don’t you see what I mean?”,</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. We are friends, aren’t we?
Real friends.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Here we are talking about this and
that, and it’s the most pleasant thing I’ve ever
done. It’s been a quiet civilized sort of time.
Not everyone is capable of such a relationship.
Don’t you think we’re a little ahead of the rest
of them?”</p>

<p>She watches you and nods. “Yes, you’re
right.”</p>

<p>Pat her hand. “You’re an adorable child.
The fire needs fixing. Just a minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ben!” she cries. “I have to go. Really.
Don’t fix it for me.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” sitting down again. “It’s caught
already. You’ll have to wait a while longer.”</p>

<p>She hesitates, looking at her wrist watch. “I
oughtn’t.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, dearest.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right.” She smiles at you. Catch
your breath and then seize her in your arms.</p>

<p>“Oh Barbara! I do love you so, much!”</p>

<p>A very limited method. There are many
girls who would refuse to be subjects on
such short notice under any circumstances
whatever. But for those who are at all
willing to aid in the experiment, this lesson
should do as well as any.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>GONNA BE NICE?</p>

<p>The crowds walk much more slowly on the
streets in the evening. They aren’t going anywhere;
they haven’t anything to do. For the
same reason, perhaps, the autos seem to loiter
as they pass the people on the pavements. They
aren’t going anywhere much. They’re open to
suggestion. Two by two the people walk; sometimes
there are more; hardly ever are there less.</p>

<p>Large groups of young boys all too young to
smoke; all smoking. Little groups of girls looking
in the shop windows. Two girls especially,
looking in the windows for lack of something better
to do. Not exactly discontented, not consciously
bored. Just looking. Just walking.</p>

<p>Among the cars is one that goes a little more
slowly even than the rest. It is a middle-aged
Dodge touring car with two boys in the front
seat, very much on the lookout. They pass the
two little girls and call out experimentally cheerful
and more or less expectant of rebuff. One of the
girls looks oblivious and yet slightly more scornful,
but the other smiles a little. On the chance
of success, the driver of the car goes around the
block and passes them again. As he disappears
around the corner for the second time, the scornful
girl suddenly relaxes.</p>

<p>“If they come back again, let’s,” she says.</p>

<p>“Sure,” says the other, indulgently. “They
look all right.”</p>

<p>A third time you call to them, and this time
the girls stop walking and stand waiting as the
car comes to a halt. The boy who is not driving
jumps out and opens the back door. Ruthie, the
scornful girl, steps in while Rosie gets into the
front seat, and the car speeds away. It has not
taken a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, where to?” you call from the back seat.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” answers Bill. “What do you
say?” he adds, turning to Rosie. “Got any favorite
drives?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Rosie, “I don’t know much about
the roads. What do you say, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Ruthie. It’s a nice name,” you say, and put
your arm around the owner of it. She does not
cuddle down, but sits up more swiftly than before.</p>

<p>“Why,” she says, with a surprising decision,
“the Jamestown road is pretty good as far as
the fence with the vine on it. When you get that
far you better turn back.”</p>

<p>Bill turns the car toward the Jamestown road
and settles down to driving, while Rosie curls up
in the other corner of the seat and watches him.
They both wait for the other one to start talking.
At last——</p>

<p>“Gee,” she says admiringly, “you sure go fast.
You ought to be careful in the city. I got a cousin
who was pinched yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Never mind; I know the cop on this
road. It ain’t so much the speed, it’s what they
call reckless driving they pinch you for. If a
fellow knows his business you can be pretty sure
they leave him alone. They don’t care for no
speed limits.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” says Rosie.</p>

<hr class='dtb'/>

<p>“Why not?” you ask. “You don’t have to hit
me in the Adam’s apple, neither.” Ruthie does
not answer, but looks out of the car with unmitigated
scorn. Pull your arm away from her
shoulder and sulk. The car bowls merrily over
the rough road until it reaches the fence with the
vines, and it shows no signs of slowing up. Rosie
does not seem to notice, but Ruthie calls promptly
from the back seat:</p>

<p>“It’s time to turn back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah,” says Bill over his shoulder. He
stops the car, pulls on the brake, and in a very
business-like manner he puts his arm around Rosie
and slumps down in the seat to a position where
he can watch the sky without craning his neck.
Ruthie waits a minute uncertainly, then turns away
from you and stares with dignity at the fence and
the field beyond it.</p>

<p>In the front seat the couple manage to find a
comfortable position as close together as possible.
You glance at them, then back at your own girl.</p>

<p>“What you so crabby about?” you ask, aggrieved.
“I ain’t pulled any rough stuff. What
do you think I am? You don’t have to be afraid.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think I am?” she demands.
“You guys think that just because a girl comes
for a ride....”</p>

<p>“Oh, can it,” wearily. “Of course I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well....” she says, as you pull her over to
him, “It really is getting sort of late.”</p>

<p>“It’s early,” you say. She shakes her head,
looking very uncomfortable hunched up against
your shoulder. She suffers it for a while, but her
mind is elsewhere.</p>

<p>“We have to go back,” she suddenly announces.
“Right away. Rosie, we have to go back.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right,” Rosie assents, cheerfully.
It all seems to be the same to Rosie. “We gotta
go, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a minute, can’t you?” you say, exasperated.
“It isn’t late at all.”</p>

<p>Adamant, your girl shakes her head and looks
expectantly at the driver. You and Bill glance at
each other and raise your eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You wait a minute,” you say, meaningly, and
Bill obligingly turns back and looks at the scenery
in front of the car.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” you say. “You’re a long ways
from home.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?” says Ruth, calmly.</p>

<p>“Yep. See? Well, are you gonna be nice?”</p>

<p>She compresses her lips. “You bet I’m gonna
be nice, big boy. Come on, Rosie,” and she opens
the door of the car and steps out to the road.
Rose hesitates, looking inquiringly at Bill. She
reaches tentatively for the door-catch.</p>

<p>Ruthie stamps her foot. “Come ON, Rosie.
You ain’t got any sense at all.”</p>

<p>Rose hesitates no longer, but steps hastily out
of her seat.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” you call together, as your respective
maidens start down the road toward town.</p>

<p>“We were only kidding,” says Bill. “Come on
back.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assents Rosie, joyfully and with
obvious relief, and she climbs back to her place.
Ruth follows more slowly. Nor does she deign
to look at you until you are back in the city street
where you met.</p>

<p>“Now where?” calls Bill. “Want some chop
suey?”</p>

<p>“We want to get out just where we got in,”
she answers with chilly sweetness. As the car
stops—“Come on, Rosie,” she says. And as Rose
trots faithfully after her, with only one wistful
backward glance——</p>

<p>“Nice ride,” she adds, over her shoulder.</p>

<p>You and Bill look at each other.</p>

<p>“You weren’t so smart,” says Bill.</p>

<p>This lesson was an old one when Herrick
counseled his young friends to gather rosebuds
while it was still possible.</p>

</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>LIFE IS SHORT</p>

<p>(They are in a canoe, and the sun has just set,
leaving behind it streaks of fading pink in the sky
and on the water. It is spring, and the woods in
the distance are losing their starkness. There is
no breeze; the air is full of a premature languor
that is not quite warmth. She lies half-prone,
with her hand trailing in the lake; and he paddles
slowly, watching her most of the time.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Ooh, the water’s terribly cold. Have
you gone swimming this spring?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Went in last week. But I was sorry.
It’s colder than it looks from the diving-board. I
was awfully surprised—it’s such a shock.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I wanted to try it today, it looked so
warm. But I guess I’ll wait a while. Last year,
all summer, we just lived in our suits. My suit
was never dry. Don’t you love to swim? It’s
my favorite exercise.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I think I like sailing better. It’s so fast.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Then you ought to like ice-boating. It’s
much faster.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No. It’s too noisy. Fast things ought
to be quiet. That’s the trouble with flying in a
machine. It isn’t really flying unless you have
wings. That must be the best feeling in the world.
Flying in a storm....</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I wouldn’t want the storm. I haven’t
that much pep. Swimming’s nice because you can
lie around so much.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You’re a lazy little thing, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> That’s what they say at home.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I like it. I hate these girls who are
always trying to be better than you are in everything.
They’re usually funny-looking, too. If
they were pretty they wouldn’t worry so much
about beating people.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You have such old-fashioned ideas.
Well, I guess you’re right. I like to be waited on.
People do things for me. I like it.... Oh, look
at that cloud. It’s getting rougher than it was—We
must be drifting out.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Yes, it goes faster than you’d think.
There’s a little wind blowing up. (Starts paddling
fast.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Going anywhere?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, I know a place that is pretty sheltered.
Say, I’m getting cold up here. Do you
mind if I get down there with you?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, that’s all right.</p>

<p>(You start to step over the intervening bar,
and the canoe sways dangerously. She screams
loudly.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Look OUT! You’re tipping us!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> (Laughing and settling down next to
her) Gosh, what a funny squeal! I never tip
canoes: don’t you know that? Have a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Thanks. The lake looks pretty, doesn’t
it? Just in this light.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Did you ever notice, it’s never the same.
Look at that boat way over there.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> It looks so little.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> It’s funny. This is a little lake, but that
boat looks tiny on it just the same.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> (Uncomprehending) Yes.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I mean we’re really awfully small when
you think about things. Stars and things. Look
at that star there——</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> First one! I’ll wish on it. (She closes
her eyes.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> It’s a little bit of a star, but I wonder
what it thinks about us. Probably it doesn’t even
know you’re wishing on it. Just think, it can’t
even see us. Just a little spot of light.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I don’t like to feel that way. I want
to be seen.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I think it’s a good feeling to know that
I don’t matter so much. I always remember it
when I’m worried about an exam. It’s a bad
habit, though, because if you start remembering
it too soon you don’t even bother to study.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I shouldn’t think anybody would. I
never feel that way unless I need sleep. I hate
it; feeling that way.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You’re too practical. I think I have
more fun my way. (Smile at her and flick your
cigarette into the water.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I don’t see that. I don’t worry, anyway.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No, but look. You take exams seriously
and spend all your time studying or fixing
clothes or something. Something really important.
Don’t you?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes. Only the thing I worry about
most is dancing. That’s important too.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, look at it my way. Look how
long the world has been going on without me and
my exams. Look how long it will go on, probably,
after I’m dead. Look how short life is anyway.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Yes....</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, I just do what I like. Studying
isn’t one of those things, see? Nobody really
likes to study.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No you don’t. You don’t really like
to keep your stockings mended, or your hair curled.
You just like the feeling afterwards that you did
what you should have done. Isn’t it true? Well,
then, if someone hadn’t taught you to like that
feeling you wouldn’t be doing those things. Now,
the things I like, I wasn’t taught. I like to eat.
Nobody ever had to tell me to do that. I like to
sleep, and swim, and sail, and kiss girls, just because
it’s fun. Itself. No reason for it, except
that if I keep on this way I can go on doing these
things and having fun until I die. I won’t want
to die, then.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Well, I think you’re the lazy one.
Where would we all be?...</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t know, but wherever it was we’d
probably like it just as well.</p>

<p>(Lean over suddenly and kiss her.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Don’t do that!</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Why not? (Kiss her again.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Stop. Why should I?</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> There you go again, asking questions.
Why? Because it’s fun.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> I don’t think it’s so much fun.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You haven’t really tried. Give me a
chance. (Kiss her again.) Now what do you
think of it?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> Not very much. Let’s go on talking
instead.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> That’s queer. You always tell me I talk
too much. I think you don’t mind this so much as
you say.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You want to think so. I just don’t see
why it’s so wonderful. I couldn’t possibly rave
the way you do, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> I don’t rave. It’s because I know what
I’m talking about and you don’t.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> You have a lot of nerve.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Well, you can see for yourself that
you’re no judge. You don’t know anything about
it. You said so yourself. And besides, if you’re
going to do so much talking about it you’re wasting
time until you know something.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> It’s no use trying to argue with you, is
it? I’m going home.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> Now you’re just running away because
you lost the argument. It isn’t my fault. You
said you wanted me to talk. All right; I’ll stop
talking.</p>

<p>(Kiss her.)</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> No, I didn’t mean that. Stop. Please
stop.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> No, I won’t. You need convincing.</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> But....</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> You mustn’t talk for five minutes. That’s
reasonable, isn’t it? Five minutes!</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> All right. (Seven minutes elapse.)
The five minutes must be up.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What did you say?</p>

<p><span class='it'>She:</span> The five minutes are over.</p>

<p><span class='it'>You:</span> What of it? What’s five minutes when
the whole evening will be over in a short time?
All of the evenings will be over some day. And
you’re quarreling about five minutes. Oh, stop
talking!</p>

it is not the type of romance which appeals to most
young women, and as a rule they ignore the signs
and play bridge. On the chance that you do not
know your Dreiser, I shall attempt to describe
the requisite technique.</p>

<p>Carrie is sitting forlornly in her chair in the
Pullman, with a closed Red Book in her lap. Sunk
in the crack of the chair is a discarded College
Comics. She doesn’t want to buy another magazine;
she wishes the man with the cap would stop
bothering her with Eskimo Pies and perfume, and
bananas and paper-backed novels. The train
smells sooty. Large hard balls of soot keep falling
into her lap. Outside the window is the same
yellowed field that she has been watching all day.
It twists and presents various corners to the passing
train, but it’s the same field just the same,
with the same wheat lining up into orderly ranks
that fall apart into chaos as the train passes on.
Twenty more hours and nothing left to think
about....</p>

<p>You walk down the aisle, staggering as the
train sways. She looks at you idly. You are tall
and skinny, and when she sees that you are beginning
to get bald, she loses interest. At the same
time you see her. You have been looking for her
ever since she passed through the club car on her
way from lunch: you like them small and blonde
and young when there are no tall and blonde and
snappy ones. Stop by her chair and smile at her.</p>

<p>“Would you like to join a party at bridge, if
I can start a game?” you ask. Her first impulse
is to refuse; not from caution, but from inertia.
It’s the same feeling that made her turn down
the man with the cap on his last journey when
she really wanted a bar of Hershey’s. But as
she shakes her head she changes her mind. Bridge!
Something to do!</p>

<p>“Why—yes, I guess so.” And she giggles a
little, from shyness.</p>

<p>“Good! I’ll get someone else and be back in a
minute.” But you return with bad tidings.
Everyone else is already playing.</p>

<p>“I guess we got the idea too late,” you announce,
sitting down in the next seat. “I wish
I’d thought of it before. There was an old fellow
in the back that asked me this morning, but he
was getting off at Chicago. Isn’t that where you
got on? How far are you going?”</p>

<p>“Colorado. I’m going to get off this train at
La Junta.” Whistle.</p>

<p>“You have pretty near as long a ride as I have.
I go clear across. Tiresome, isn’t it? I ought to
be used to it, but I never am, somehow.”</p>

<p>“What do you do?”</p>

<p>“Furniture. Wholesale furniture. I’m traveling
for a firm in Tucson; Robinson and Company.
Have you ever been there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; this is my first trip West.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nice town, but hot right now. I’m lucky
to be away. Just had a letter from my—my sister
and she says the heat is unbearable. Unbearable.”</p>

<p>She murmurs sympathetically and looks back
at the wheat, while you remember that at times
you talk too much about yourself. Ah, well
then....</p>

<p>“If it isn’t too personal—what part of the country
do you hail from?”</p>

<p>“Illinois. Darien. It’s just a little town. I’m
going out to Colorado to visit and maybe I’m
going to stay. If I can get a job teaching and if
I like the country, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Really? Now, I’d have said you were from
New York.”</p>

<p>There is a pleased little silence.</p>

<p>“Why, what a funny idea. Why should you
think I’m from New York?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. A man in my business gets
so he can spot people pretty quickly, and he can’t
exactly tell how, nine times out of ten.”</p>

<p>“Kind of second nature?”</p>

<p>“Yes, second nature. I don’t know just why
I did think you were from New York. Your
clothes, or perhaps the way you talk. Or the way
you know how to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell anything about that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s easy. A man can always tell. You
can take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>She blushes and remembers that she is all alone
on this train.</p>

<p>“Well,” slightly raising your voice, “I do like
New York. It looks pretty good when you’ve
been out in the sticks for a couple of months.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s no place like New York for shows.
I wouldn’t like to live there, but it’s a good place
to visit. My—my mother used to live there, and
I never could see how she stood it as long as she
did.”</p>

<p>She answers with animation. “Oh, but the little
towns get so dull! There just isn’t anything to
do out in the country.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to do? Why, gee, what’s the matter
with fishing? Two weeks a year isn’t enough fishing
for me!”</p>

<p>“But of course you’re a man.”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s right. A man feels different. I
admit I don’t understand women, and I bet I’m
as bright as the next one. There’s not a man
alive can understand a woman.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’re right.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it time to eat? Let’s go on in and see.
Will you have dinner with me?”</p>

<p>“Why—I don’t know——”</p>

<p>“What’s the harm?”</p>

<p>No nice girl will admit the possibility of harm.
She ignores your remark, therefore, by rising and
starting for the dining car. It is seven cars away,
and some of the long passages are difficult to
manage without staggering from side to side.
Hold her elbow in a firm grasp, squeezing it as
she stumbles against you, and laugh a good deal.
You are much better friends when you reach the
diner.</p>

<p>She looks out of the window at the sweeping
darkness and you watch her and she knows it.
The speed of the train and the feeling of not belonging
anywhere are very exciting. What will
Colorado be like? What is it all about anyway?
No one in the train is a real person; they are all
simply part of an adventure, like the armies and
mobs in the background of a moving picture. Even
the man across the table—isn’t he simply part of
it too? The most exciting part? A personification
of the whole thing, the whole waiting world.... I’d
have said you were from New York.... You
can take care of yourself.... I certainly
can.... She smiles at you suddenly, defiantly,
gayly. “What were you thinking about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. The future, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Let’s drink to it.” Hold up
your water glass. “To your future, and may it
include me.”</p>

<p>She laughs again, recklessly. Lean over the
table.</p>

<p>“Will it, kid? Will it?”</p>

<p>“Oh——how do I know? I’m no fortune
teller.” Again she turns to the window. There
are no fields to be seen now, but the stars look
very large. Stars and darkness and the train
going somewhere—somewhere—somewhere. And
that man looking at her and appreciating all her
expressions and knowing that he doesn’t understand
her; wondering about her....</p>

<p>“Now what are you thinking about?”</p>

<p>But she’ll never tell you. You’ll always wonder
about the girl you met on the train for a
few minutes. Ships that pass in the night. It’s
exciting to be going somewhere.</p>

<p>She doesn’t want any more ice cream. Go back
to her chair and when someone asks you to play
bridge refuse without even consulting her. No
matter. Stare out of the window.</p>

<p>“You know, it’s a funny thing. This has been
a much better day than I expected.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know. I thought it would be just the
same. You can imagine, riding on trains day in,
day out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can imagine.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you got on at Chicago, that’s all.
You won’t be sore at me for saying so? I’ve got
to say what I think, to you.”</p>

<p>She can feel just how it must be. Your profile
looks so tired.</p>

<p>Turn to her suddenly. “I’m talking like a
crazy person. Do you think I’m crazy?”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t.”</p>

<p>Settle back again. “Good. I’m not really, but
I guess most people would think so.”</p>

<p>“Why should they?”</p>

<p>“Talking like this to a girl I just met on the
train.”</p>

<p>“Talking like what? You haven’t said anything.”
She is really bewildered.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I?” Look at her again, quickly.
“You know, that’s a queer thing. I thought I had.
I thought I’d said lots of things. Do you ever
have that feeling?”</p>

<p>“Oh—that. Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know what I’m going to say, right
now. You’ll probably be mad at me.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re a darned good sport.”</p>

<p>“Why? You don’t know. You don’t know
anything about me at all.”</p>

<p>“Sure I do. I’m not dumb. I’ve been watching
you all day and I guess I can tell as well as
the next one. Do you know what I think about
you?”</p>

<p>“How should I?”</p>

<p>“I think probably you’re awfully nice.” Put
your hand over hers. “I know you are. You’re
all excited, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“You’re shaking. What’s the matter? Scared
of me?” Your hand tightens.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” She is annoyed with herself. It’s
hard on the nerves, sitting in a train all day. Almost
time to go to bed, she thinks—the porter has
started at the other end of the car; his head is
immersed in the upper berth in the corner.</p>

<p>“It’s getting late,” you say, understanding her.
She nods and thinks with a new terror of arriving
in a strange town. Nervous.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” you add. There is another silence.
Some perverse shyness keeps her from saying
anything. It is almost as if, against her own will,
she waits for something fateful. But say no more.
Pat her hand and settle back, looking up at the
top of the car.</p>

<p>Slowly, followed by a mysterious growth of
little green cabins, the porter approaches you,
slamming down chair-covers, manipulating linen.</p>

<p>Sit up with a new briskness.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the smoker,” you announce. “But
listen, I’m not going to say good-bye.” She looks
at you and waits. Her tongue won’t move; is
it curiosity? Nervous....</p>

<p>“I’m coming in to say good-night,” say, your
eyes fixed on hers. “I have a book to lend you.
So long.” Rise, and then put your hand over hers
again. She simply stares at you.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice kid,” you observe, and walk
away.</p>

<p>Slowly she stands and picks up her suitcase as
the porter reaches her chair in his constructive
progress. Slowly she walks down the aisle to the
Ladies’ Room. A sudden flush of thought as she
gets there—she drops the bag and looks into the
mirror, horror-stricken. Why didn’t she say something?
What should she do now? Then as she
thinks, she feels better. He’s simply coming to
say good-night. Sure, he’ll probably try to kiss
her, but—oh, well, stop thinking. Just the same
she’ll wear her dressing gown to bed; no use giving
him ideas. Everything seems so different on
a train; if it would stop making a noise and let
you think straight.... Ships that pass in the
night. What’s the difference?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>SHE LOVED ME FOR THE DANGERS</p>

<p>It is a dull afternoon in the sorority house and
Dorothy is trying to make up her mind to study;
but she isn’t having much success. In fact, the
idea is so unattractive that she doesn’t waste more
than half a minute trying. Everybody has gone to
the last game of the season across the river, and
Dot didn’t go because she has used up all her
week-ends. Oh, well ... Sunday afternoon and
five hours before her date. Nothing left to read.
Washed her hair yesterday—you mustn’t do that
more than once a week. Manicured her nails
before lunch. Plucked her eyebrows, darned her
stockings—oh, bother Sunday afternoon. And
there is a theme due on Tuesday, but that’s a
long time and anyway you write better themes at
the last minute. Oh, glory, there’s the phone.
What if just once it could be someone unexpected?</p>

<p>“Miss Dormer? This is Donald Banks, from
Los Angeles. I have a letter for you from Genevieve
Reed. When I left I mentioned that I might
be coming through here and she thought——”</p>

<p>“Why, any friend of Jen’s—why, of course.
Can’t you come over?”</p>

<p>“I’d very much like to. When would it be convenient?”</p>

<p>“Any time this afternoon. I think I’m busy tonight,
but if you’d like to come over now or pretty
soon it would be all right.”</p>

<p>Well! Oh, well, he’ll probably be a mess. Jen
never mentioned him. Haven’t heard from Jen
lately, though. It wouldn’t be like her to send
up a wet smack.</p>

<p>No, you aren’t a wet smack at first glance, anyway.
Interesting looking. Lean and distinguished;
something like Lewis Stone, if not quite
so tall. How funny of you to think that the sitting-room
is really a place to sit—surely no one
else spent all afternoon on that horse-hair sofa
since the Dean of Women was a pup. If you
were one of the boys you’d know enough to suggest
going out. But it is rather fun at that.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think,” she protests, “that
you have to go just because it’s so quiet. We’re
allowed to have visitors indefinitely on Sunday.”</p>

<p>Laugh. “You’re tired, though. I remember
Sunday afternoon at school from my own experience.
Thank you, and—I may see you quite soon
again? Not only, I assure you, because my time
in your city is so limited.”</p>

<p>Ooo, what a funny way to talk! “Certainly.”
It is queer, how hard it is to keep from getting an
accent like that too, while she talks to him. “Yes,
I’d like to see you again before you leave. It
doesn’t happen to be a very—busy time for me
just now.”</p>

<p>“How fortunate! I don’t want to interfere
with your studies. Can’t we have dinner this evening?”</p>

<p>“Oh—why—yes, thank you, I’d like to. At six-thirty?
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Oh, well, Tom ought to excuse her for an out-of-town
friend. That is perfectly legitimate.</p>

<p>“Hello. Alpha Belt house? Is that Tom?
Well, listen, Tom? I hope you won’t be perfectly
furious because I really can’t help it, but it’s this
way——”</p>

<hr class='dtb'/>

<p>A co-ed is a well-protected person, in spite of
what may be read in the newspapers about her
freedom. She is so hemmed in by public opinion—not
the opinion of the outside world, but that
of her own public, the campus—that it is with a
distinct sense of guilt that she associates with
anyone so foreign as an out-of-town visitor, be
his appearance ever so distinguished. Not that
Dorothy isn’t thrilled as well as apprehensive. If
she dared, she would even have dined in the roseate
and familiar publicity of Ye Kandy Shoppe,
stared at by her friends and causing a poorly
concealed flurry of gossip. But you would be
puzzled by Ye Kandy Shoppe, and perhaps dissatisfied
with the food. That is why you proceed
solemnly through the menu of the Imperial Hotel
Dining-room, sherbet-on-the-side and all, surrounded
by the younger married set of the town,
with an occasional drummer or a professor’s party.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I see that you know Genevieve quite
well,” you are saying. “Much better than I do.
It’s perhaps the only fault that I can find with my
work—the lack of real social contact. Going and
coming as I do, I must resign myself to being the
picturesque figure; oft forgotten. Interesting,
perhaps, but so occasionally!” Smile.</p>

<p>“But doesn’t your work keep you in one place at
a time pretty much?” asks Dorothy. “I thought
it took at least six years at a time to build bridges.
Surely there are people there—in Abyssinia, or
wherever you’re going next?”</p>

<p>“People? My dear child, you’ve been going
to the movies. The natives are really dark—much
more so than you seem to suspect. Of course
once in a while you do find people, and if they are
people at all, you understand, they mean much
more to you than they would here, at home. That
mode of life has given me a distressingly intense
way of taking my friends, I find. You children
with your great circles of acquaintances wouldn’t
understand my attitude.”</p>

<p>“I might,” she says, eagerly. “Once I spent a
summer camping—in Maine—with just three
other people, and I certainly was glad to get back
to town. I was so sick of them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that might give you some idea of it. But
don’t misunderstand me. I wouldn’t give it up
for anything. After all in the face of certain
things, what do people matter? I give you my
word—” here your face grows intent as you
finger a fork; you seem to have forgotten Dorothy
and the dining-room “—a man gets pretty close
to the fundamental reason for things, out there.
So close that he is perilously near to discovery.
What keeps him from going farther? Sometimes
he goes too far. Sometimes a boy is sent back
home just for going too far—for discovering, or
thinking he has discovered.... Fever? Insanity?
Truth?”</p>

<p>Dorothy shivers. The tawdry dining-room is
forgotten in dark imaginings. Slimy twisted vegetation,
slow streams of oily water, houses built
on stilts, lifted from the swamp.... Or the
monotonous sun of the desert; the undulating,
glaring floor of sand with one heroic little clump
of tents....</p>

<p>“Would you care to dance?” You have come
out of it. She smiles, rather late, and nods. You
dance the way they do in those places in Europe,
she thinks—slow and romantic, not hopping all
over, like Tom.</p>

<p>“When do you start back again?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sure. I won’t know until I
get back to New York. They keep these things
quiet, of course—international policy, I might
say.” For the first time, your smile is for her;
a personal thing. “I have a very definite regret
that my visit is so short. It’s an unaccustomed
feeling. The last time I saw civilization—let’s
see, it must have been four years ago—I was positively
glad to go back. Where do they keep you
young girls? Are you always at school? Ah,
well—thank education for our salvation!”</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine you at a movie, she
thinks. You go, however, and sit through a news
weekly, a very old domestic comedy, at which you
laugh quite surprisingly hard, and half a problem
picture before you give it up.</p>

<p>“I say,” you suddenly announce, “stupid of me
not to have thought of it before. Simply driving
somewhere would be better than this. Or have
you a rule about cars and that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we must have, but no one ever pays
any attention to it.”</p>

<p>You must drive a good way before the Sunday
traffic is at last left behind.</p>

<p>“You drive well for not being used to the city,”
she ventures.</p>

<p>“It’s good fun,” you explain. “Much more
dangerous than the life out there. And you mean
to say that you do a lot of driving? In streets
like those in town? Brave girl!”</p>

<p>Safe from the eyes of any university official,
she takes a cigarette. Your silence and proximity
are very thrilling; there will be a lot to tell the
room mate when she gets back. Or perhaps it
would be better not to say too much—to act as
if this sort of out-of-town friend is to be expected
from a background like Dorothy’s. She is rather
different than the usual co-ed, anyway, she thinks
comfortably. More interesting friends, on the
whole. Of course these little boys are all right
when you have nothing else....</p>

<p>Stop the car on the edge of the Hawk Bluff,
which in the sober light of common day looks out
over a not-very-far-down golf course, but which
now hangs over mysterious abysses.</p>

<p>“Dorothy,” you say.</p>

<p>It has come at last; she knows it and turns to
you with the fatal feeling of one for whom circumstance
has been too strong. And then nothing
happens for a minute.</p>

<p>“You are a lovely child,” you say. Then, very
quickly, draw her to you and kiss her on the brow.
And then drive home through the quiet night.
Anyway, it is quiet until you reach town and the
boisterous returning students.</p>

<p>Home again, an hour before she has to be.
Stand in the light-speckled gloom of the verandah
and say farewell.</p>

<p>“So very, very nice of Jen. I’ll never forget
it. Something to remember when I go
back.... Lovely child.”</p>

<p>And without even another kiss on the brow you
are gone.</p>

<p>Does Dorothy call up the Alpha Delt house to
arrange for a malted before she goes to bed?
Or does she go to her room and sit there in the
dark, thinking?</p>

<p>She goes to her room quite thoroughly, as it
were, seduced. After all, this is the most subtle
method of them all.</p>
